@W: MT529 :"c:\users\labas\desktop\skaitmenine logika\lab_4\m1.vhd":20:2:20:3|Found inferred clock CNT10|CLK which controls 5 sequential elements including CNT_A[3:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
