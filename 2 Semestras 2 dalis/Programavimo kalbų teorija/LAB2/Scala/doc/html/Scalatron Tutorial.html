<p>Scalatron is an educational resource for groups of programmers that want to learn more about
the Scala programming language or want to hone their Scala programming skills. It is based on
Scalatron BotWar, a competitive multi-player programming game in which coders pit bot programs
(written in Scala) against each other.</p>

<p>The documentation, tutorial and source code are intended as a community resource and are
in the public domain. Feel free to use, copy, and improve them!</p>

<h1 id = "Summary">Summary</h1>

<p>The behavior of each bot is determined by an associated computer program fragment that
implements a control function mapping inputs (what the bot sees) to outputs (how the bot
responds).</p>

<p>This tutorial explains (very briefly) what Scala is and (in slightly more detail)
how to write a bot program in Scala. It is based on the following premises:</p>

<ul>
<li>you already know how to program, probably in Java or C++</li>
<li>the quickest way for a programmer to understand almost anything is to look at sample code
and to play around with working programs, modifying and incrementally improving them.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this tutorial simply presents and analyzes the code to increasingly sophisticated bots,
which you can immediately try out and run in the game server. With each version, additional
Scala syntax is explained and the most important language constructs introduced. The idea is
to let you get from zero to a running bot that you can play with very quickly, and to let you
zip through the tutorial at your own pace, picking up useful tools as you go.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<h1 id = "Introduction_To_Scala">Introduction To Scala</h1>

<h2 id = "What_is_Scala_">What is Scala?</h2>

<p>Scala is a programming language invented by Martin Odersky in 2000. It is statically typed
(like Java) and combines functional (FP) and object oriented (OO) features. Just like Java,
Scala compiles into Java byte code and can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Scala
interoperates well with Java and can serve as a by-file or by-module replacement for Java.
In many, many respects it fixes the things that are awkward or broken in Java.</p>

<h2 id = "Comparison_to_Java">Comparison to Java</h2>

<p>The syntax of Scala overall is quite similar to Java, but in general it omits elements that
are not strictly necessary and place a burden on the programmer (such as semicolons or
type declarations that are inferable for the compiler) and generally required less
boilerplate code.</p>

<p>The result is that Scala code is often only a third or a quarter of the size of equivalent
Java code.</p>

<h2 id = "Scala_Performance">Scala Performance</h2>

<p>The performance of Scala depends on how you code. Code written in a functional style can be
slower to execute in certain circumstances; code written in an imperative, procedural will
be as fast as in Java.</p>

<p>However, functional code is</p>

<ul>
<li>much more concise,</li>
<li>much faster to write,</li>
<li>much easier to compose</li>
<li>much easier to parallelize</li>
</ul>

<p>So generally, writing functional code is preferable for the vast majority of code.
Nevertheless, Scala lets you fall back to imperative code for performance critical
sections.</p>

<h1 id = "How_to_get_your_bot_into_the_game">How to get your bot into the game</h1>

<p>Throughout the tutorial, you will create increasingly complex bot versions in Scala.
To see your bot appear in the game, you will need to compile and publish it.
There are two approaches to doing this, which in the Scalatron documentation are referred to
as the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; and &ldquo;casual&rdquo; paths, respectively.</p>

<h2 id = "The__ldquo_Casual_rdquo__Path">The &ldquo;Casual&rdquo; Path</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;casual&rdquo; path is intended for less experienced programmers or for shorter bot coding sessions
(2-3 hours). On this path, players write, build, debug and publish their bots in a web browser. 
The browser-based development environment is provided by an embedded web server which is hosted
inside the game server and requires no setup by the user.</p>

<p>If this is the path you want to follow, here is how to do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>open a web browser and point it to the game server's address, which you can get from the
workshop organizer. It will generally be something like <code>http://scalatron:8080</code></li>
<li>log into the account associated with your name. If there is no account for you displayed
on the log-in screen, ask the workshop organizer to create one for you.</li>
<li>enter your code in the editor that appears. You can also copy and paste code from the tutorial
and example bot sources.</li>
<li>click the <em>Build</em> button. This will upload your code to the game server, compile it there,
and display a list of errors (if there were any). Do this until your code compiles.</li>
<li>click the <em>Build and Run in Sandbox</em> button. This will upload and compile your code and then
start a private, &ldquo;sandboxed&rdquo; game for your bot on the server. You can single-step through the
simulation and observe the view and state of your bot. Tune your bot until you are happy with it.</li>
<li>click the <em>Build and Publish into Tournament</em> button. This will upload and compile your code and
then publish it into the tournament loop, where it will be picked up automatically when the
next game rounds starts.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id = "The__ldquo_Serious_rdquo__Path">The &ldquo;Serious&rdquo; Path</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;serious&rdquo; path is intended for experienced programmers planning for a longer bot coding
session (5-7 hours). On this path, bots are built locally by each player, using an IDE or command
line tools. The bots are then published into the tournament by copying them into the plug-in
directory on the central computer from which the game server loads them at the start of each
round.</p>

<p>If this is the path you want to follow, here is how to do it:</p>

<h3 id = "Compiling">Compiling</h3>

<p>To compile your bot, you need to feed your Scala source file through the Scala compiler.
How you do this depends on the build environment you are using. If you are using the
IntelliJ IDEA setup described in the document <em>Player Setup</em>, all you will need
to do is select <strong>Build > Make Project</strong> from the main menu. This should perform the
following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>incrementally compile your source file into <code>.class</code> files using the <em>Fast Scala Compiler (FSC)</em></li>
<li>package the resulting <code>.class</code> files into a Java Archive <code>.jar</code> artifact file</li>
<li>copy the <code>.jar</code> file into your bot directory on the game server</li>
</ol>

<p>Once your plug-in <code>.jar</code> file was copied to the game server, it should be picked up as soon as
the next game round starts. You can see how far the current round has progressed and estimate
how long you'll have to wait in the bottom left corner of the screen, where it will say something
like:</p>

<pre><code>round 42: 240 steps (of 1000), 4.0s, 20ms/step</code></pre>

<h3 id = "Publishing">Publishing</h3>

<p>The publishing process basically consist of copying the <code>.jar</code> plug-in file you built
into your plug-in directory on the server.</p>

<p>This directory will be a sub-directory with your name below a network-shared directory
available to all users, which the workshop organizer should have made available to everyone.
Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>the organizer published a network-shared directory that is visible on your computer as
<code>/Volumes/Scalatron/bots/</code></li>
<li>within this directory, if your name is Tina, you will at some point create a sub-directory
called <code>Tina</code></li>
<li>into this directory you will publish (i.e., copy) your <code>.jar</code> file, which must be
called <code>ScalatronBot.jar</code></li>
<li>the complete path where your plug-in resides is therefore
<code>/Volumes/Scalatron/bots/Tina/ScalatronBot.jar</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For more details, see the <em>Scalatron Server Setup</em> guide and the <em>Scalatron Protocol</em>
documentation.</p>

<h3 id = "Updating_a_bot_plug-in">Updating a bot plug-in</h3>

<p>The details of how you publish a newly built bot plug-in depend on how the system running the
game server is configured.</p>

<p>In some configurations, new plug-in versions can simply overwrite old ones, even as part of
the build process. This is obviously the most convenient setup, since you can configure your
IDE to build the <code>.jar</code> artifact directly into the plug-in directory.</p>

<p>In other configurations, the existing <code>.jar</code> file may be locked, in which case you must first
move that file to another location or delete it.</p>

<h1 id = "Bot__1:_Hello_World">Bot #1: Hello World</h1>

<h2 id = "Objective">Objective</h2>

<p>Create a minimal bot that compiles and appears in the game.</p>

<h2 id = "Source_Code">Source Code</h2>

<p>Create a source code file called &ldquo;Bot.scala&rdquo; and type the following code into it:</p>

<pre><code>class ControlFunctionFactory {
    def create = new ControlFunction().respond _
}

class ControlFunction {
    def respond(input: String) = "Status(text=Hello World)"
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: the source code for all bots contained in this tutorial is also available in the
appropriate sub-directories of the <code>/samples</code> directory of the Scalatron installation. You can
also access the samples directly through the browser user interface exposed by the server.</p>

<p><strong>Caution</strong>: when you copy source code from a PDF file and paste it into your IDE, it is
possible that some characters will be modified and that newlines will be missing, leading to
compiler errors. The best way to avoid this is to either type in the code (sorry) or to copy the
code from from the samples on disk.</p>

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>The code defines two classes, <code>ControlFunctionFactory</code> and <code>ControlFunction</code>. In each class, it defines one
method. The method <code>ControlFunctionFactory.create()</code> constructs a new instance of the class <code>ControlFunction</code>
and returns a reference to its <code>respond()</code> method. This is the control function that the game
server will invoke to interact with the bot.</p>

<p>The method <code>ControlFunction.respond()</code> receives a <code>String</code> parameter (which it ignores)
and returns a constant string that contains a command for the game server, in this case the
command Status() which asks the server to set the status text of the bot to &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_class__code__do_">What does <code>class</code> do?</h3>

<p>The class keyword begins the definition of a new class.</p>

<p>Examples in our bot:</p>

<pre><code>class ControlFunctionFactory { ... }
class ControlFunction { ... }</code></pre>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_def__code__do_">What does <code>def</code> do?</h3>

<p>The def keyword defines a function or method.</p>

<p>Examples in our bot:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>def create = new ControlFunction().respond _</code>
<ul>
<li>defines a method create() in the class <code>ControlFunctionFactory</code></li>
<li>that takes no parameters</li>
<li>that returns a function of type <code>String =&gt; String</code></li>
<li>the return type is inferred by the compiler from the method body</li>
<li>the body uses new to create an instance of class <code>ControlFunction</code></li>
<li>it then returns a reference to the <code>respond()</code> method of class <code>ControlFunction</code> whose execution context is the instance we just created</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>def respond(input: String) = "Status(text=Hello World)"</code>
<ul>
<li>defines a method <code>respond()</code> in the class <code>ControlFunction</code></li>
<li>that takes one parameter of type String called input</li>
<li>that returns a String</li>
<li>the return type is inferred by the compiler from the method body</li>
<li>the body consists of the String constant <code>"Status(text=Hello World)"</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Other examples:</p>

<pre><code>def foo: Int = 1                    // function without side-effects
def foo = 1                         // Scala infers return type

def bar(s: String): String = "Hello"
def bar(s: String) = "Hello"        // Scala infers return type

def bar(): Unit = { println(..)     // function with side-effects
def bar() { ... }                   // Scala infers return type</code></pre>

<h2 id = "How_are_types_specified_">How are types specified?</h2>

<p>In Scala, names precede types:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(input: String) : String = ""
val bar: Int = 1
val l: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)</code></pre>

<p>Types can be omitted if they can be inferred by the compiler:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(input: String) = ""
val bar = 1
val l = List(1, 2, 3)</code></pre>

<h3 id = "What_types_are_available_in_Scala_">What types are available in Scala?</h3>

<p>Scala has all the basic types of Java:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>String</code></li>
<li><code>Int</code></li>
<li><code>Double</code></li>
<li><code>Char</code></li>
<li><code>Array[T]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Scala also has functions as values and has the appropriate types.
Example: a function that takes a string and returns a string:</p>

<pre><code>val foo: String =&gt; String = input =&gt; input + "."</code></pre>

<p>If we want to omit the type on the left-hand side, we need to tell the compiler
about it on the right-hand side:</p>

<pre><code>val foo = (input: String) =&gt; input + "."</code></pre>

<h3 id = "Why_is_there_no__code_return__code__statement_">Why is there no <code>return</code> statement?</h3>

<p>In Scala, and in functional programming in general, you should think of methods and most
code elements as expressions that yield the result of the expression as their value.
Instead of writing, for example, code like:</p>

<pre><code>int n = 0
if(x.isEmpty) n=1 else n=2</code></pre>

<p>we can write</p>

<pre><code>val n = if(x.isEmpty) 1 else 2</code></pre>

<p>Likewise, we can view entire methods as expressions that yield a value. Instead of writing</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String) = { return "" }</code></pre>

<p>we can write</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String) = ""</code></pre>

<p>Scala does have a <code>return</code> statement, but using it is frowned upon as poor functional
programming practice and occurrences of <code>return</code> are considered by many as a &ldquo;code smell&rdquo;.
If you do want to use return (for example to break out of a loop), note that you must
explicitly specify the return type of the method from which you want to return.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does_the_underscore_after__code_respond__code__mean_">What does the underscore after <code>respond</code> mean?</h3>

<p>From the <code>create()</code> method, we want to return a function value, namely the method <code>respond()</code>
of our newly created <code>ControlFunction</code> instance. The underscore, by appearing instead of the parameter
list of <code>respond()</code>, tells the compiler that we do not wish to invoke the function but to
turn it into a value. If you are not familiar with functional programming, this may be a
bit confusing but don't be put off by it - you do not yet need to understand the details
of this right now and it'll appear quite trivial later on.</p>

<h1 id = "Bot__2:_Counting_Cycles">Bot #2: Counting Cycles</h1>

<h2 id = "Objective">Objective</h2>

<p>Make the bot display on the screen the number of times its control function was invoked.</p>

<h2 id = "Source_Code">Source Code</h2>

<pre><code>// ControlFunctionFactory definition is done as it stands
// from now on, we'll omit it

class ControlFunction {
    var n = 0
    def respond(input: String) = {
        val output = "Status(text=" + n + ")"   // temp value
        n += 1                                  // now increments after use
        output                                  // yield
    }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>We're from now on omitting the definition of the ControlFunctionFactory class,
since it will never change. Just leave it at the top of your source file for now.</p>

<p>In the code, we add a mutable field <code>n</code> to the definition of our <code>ControlFunction</code> class. From the
assignment of the zero value, the compiler infers that this field will have type <code>Int</code>.</p>

<p>In our <code>respond()</code> method, instead of returning a constant string as the status message,
we now construct a new string every time by concatenating multiple sub-strings and storing
the result in a temporary, immutable value called <code>output</code>. One of these sub-strings is a
String rendering of our counter field. The compiler conveniently converts the Int into a
String for us.</p>

<p>We then increment the counter by one and return the string we constructed earlier.
We indicate that we want to return the constructed string by simply making a reference
to the <code>output</code> value the last expression in the method.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;yielding&rdquo; behavior of functional languages is also the reason we create the temporary
value in the first place: if <code>n += 1</code> was the last expression in our method, that would also
be the return value of the method.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_var__code__do_">What does <code>var</code> do?</h3>

<p>The <code>var</code> keyword defines a new mutable value, which can be a local variable in a method
or a mutable field of a class. Note that mutability is generally frowned upon by functional
programmers since it makes it more difficult to reason about the state and behavior of
programs.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_val__code__do_">What does <code>val</code> do?</h3>

<p>The <code>val</code> keyword defines a new immutable value, which can be a local constant in a method
or an immutable field of a class. Because it is immutable, its value can never change.</p>

<h3 id = "Where_do_I_need_curly_braces_">Where do I need curly braces?</h3>

<p>Generally speaking you need curly braces to define the body of a class and to group
multiple statements into a block. That's why this method definition does not need curly braces:</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String) = "Status(text=" + n + ")"</code></pre>

<p>but this one does:</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String) = {
    val output = "Status(text=" + n + ")"
    n += 1
    output
}</code></pre>

<h3 id = "Where_do_I_need_a_semicolon_">Where do I need a semicolon?</h3>

<p>Unlike in Java, you do not need a semicolon at the end of every statement. For the moment,
the only reason you might want to use a semicolon is to separate multiple expressions on
the same line, like this:</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String) = { n += 1; "Status(text=Hello)" }</code></pre>

<h3 id = "Why_do_we_store_the_output_in_a_temporary_constant_">Why do we store the output in a temporary constant?</h3>

<p>Scala yields the value of the last expression in a method as the result value of that
method. To see what this means, consider the following variants of the code above:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: mutable field, but no incrementation</p>

<pre><code>class ControlFunction {
    var n = 0           // declare mutable field
    def respond(input: String) = "Status(text=" + n + ")"
}</code></pre>

<p>This code obviously always returns the same string.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: field incrementation before String concatenation</p>

<pre><code>class ControlFunction {
    var n = 0
    def respond(input: String) = {  // curly braces for scope
        n += 1                      // increment counter
        "Status(text=" + n + ")"
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>This code returns a string containing an incrementing counter, but the counter does not
start at zero. Because it is incremented before the string is constructed, the first
value returned is one.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>class ControlFunction {
    var n = 0
    def respond(input: String) : String = {
        "Status(text=" + n + ")"
        n += 1                          // BUG: yields Int (the updated n), not string
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>This now constructs the correct text, but instead of returning the text it returns&hellip; nothing.
The last statement of the <code>respond()</code> method is <code>n += 1</code>, which is a shorthand for <code>n = n + 1</code>,
which does not yield a value. So the compiler (correctly) infers the type of the function to
be <code>String =&gt; Unit</code>, where <code>Unit</code> is the Scala equivalent of Java's <code>void</code>.</p>

<p>If we do not explicitly declare the return type of the function to be <code>String</code>, as shown above,
this means that the compiler will generate <code>respond()</code> with a <code>Unit</code> return type and will
consequently also generate the factory method as <code>() =&gt; (String =&gt; Unit)</code>. Because the compiler
has no idea what we want, it will not report an error. But when we try to publish the bot into
the tournament, the Scalatron server will reject it because it can't find a factory function
with the expected signature <code>() =&gt; (String =&gt; String)</code>.</p>

<p>If we explicitly declare the return type of the method as <code>String</code>, however, as we do in the
code above, then the compiler can notice the discrepancy and complain about it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>class ControlFunction {
    var n = 0
    def respond(input: String) = {
        val output = "Status(text=" + n + ")"   // temp value
        n += 1                                  // now increments after use
        output                                  // yield
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>This creates a temporary constant value of type <code>String</code>, then increments the
value, and finally references the constant value again to make it the return
value of the function. Now everything works as expected.</p>

<h1 id = "Bot__3:_Checking_the_Opcode">Bot #3: Checking the Opcode</h1>

<h2 id = "Objective">Objective</h2>

<p>We now want to let the bot distinguish between the different commands that the game server
may pass as input parameters into the control function, such as &ldquo;React&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo;.
To do that, we need to parse the input string provided by the server. Here is a simplified
input string (for details, check the Scalatron Protocol documentation):</p>

<pre><code>React(generation=0,time=0,view=__W_W_W__,energy=100)</code></pre>

<p>We will modify the control function to now only respond with a command if the server sends
an input containing a <code>React()</code> opcode. To make the bot behavior a little more interesting,
we will have it return a <code>Move()</code> command, prompting the bot to run towards the right.</p>

<h2 id = "Source_Code">Source Code</h2>

<p>The <code>ControlFunctionFactory</code> and <code>ControlFunction</code> boilerplate code remains unchanged from the
previous example; we replace only the <code>respond()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String) = {
    val tokens = input.split('(')   // split at '(', returns Array[String]
    if(tokens(0)=="React") {        // token(0): 0th element of array
        "Move(direction=1:0)"       // response if true
    } else {
        ""                          // response if false
    }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>First, we need to extract the opcode from the command string. A simple way to achieve
this is to use one of the library methods that Scala offers for values of type <code>String</code>.
Namely, we use the <code>split()</code> method, which takes a value of type <code>Char</code> as a parameter,
to break the string into a collection of sub-strings at all occurrences of that character
value (here, occurrences of the opening parenthesis that immediately follows an opcode).</p>

<p><code>String.split()</code> returns a result of type <code>Array[String]</code>. We extract the first array
element, which should now contain the string representing the opcode, and compare it
to the expected opcode. Unlike in Java, in Scala the comparison with <code>==</code> does what you
expect.</p>

<p>If the opcode is <code>React</code>, we return a <code>Move()</code> command. Otherwise we return an empty
string.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_split____code__do_">What does <code>split()</code> do?</h3>

<p><code>String.split()</code> breaks a string into a collection of sub-strings at occurrences of a given
separator character. It is defined in the Scala library and has the following signature:</p>

<pre><code>def split(separator: Char) : Array[String]</code></pre>

<p>So it takes a value of type <code>Char</code> as a parameter (the separator) and returns a result of
type <code>Array[String]</code> (the sub-strings).</p>

<p>Example: <code>"a(b)".split('(')</code> returns <code>Array("a", "b)")</code></p>

<h3 id = "What_are_some_other_methods_available_on__code_String__code__">What are some other methods available on <code>String</code>?</h3>

<p>A good way to learn about the methods available at any point in your code is to use
your IDE's auto-complete method. This is highly recommended, since e.g. the Scala
plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA will also display methods available through implicit
conversions, something that is extremely convenient but initially somewhat hard to
fathom for people new to Scala.</p>

<p>Here are a few more methods available on String:</p>

<pre><code>val a = "Hello" + " " + "World"
a.length            // = 11

<h3 id = "How_does_the__code_if__code__statement_work_">How does the <code>if</code> statement work?</h3>

<p>Remember that in Scala, you should think of your code components as expressions. Here,
the if block is an expression whose result value is either the value of the true branch
or the false branch:</p>

<pre><code>if(condition) { true-block } else { false-block }</code></pre>

<p>This is actually a bit similar to the '?:' operator, which is not
necessary in Scala.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>val b = if(true) true else false
val a = if(b) false else true
val not : Boolean =&gt; Boolean = in =&gt; if(in) false else true</code></pre>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_tokens_0___code__do_">What does <code>tokens(0)</code> do?</h3>

<p>In Scala, you retrieve a particular element of an array by specifying its (zero-based)
index in simple parentheses. Since <code>tokens</code> is an <code>Array[String]</code> that was returned by
<code>String.split()</code>, the expression <code>tokens(0)</code> returns the first element (at index zero)
of that array.</p>

<p>Assignment to array elements works in the same manner. Here are some additional examples
of working with arrays:</p>

<pre><code>val nums = Array(1, 2, 3)
val strings = Array("Hello", "World")
val empty = Array.empty[Int]

val s0 = strings(0)     // read
nums(1) = 9             // write</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Objective">Objective</h2>

<p>Instead of a counter, we want to display the bot's current energy level next to it on the
screen. To do that, we first have to extract the energy from the input string and then set
it as the bot's status string using the <code>Status()</code> command. The server informs the bot about
its energy level via the <code>energy</code> parameter of the input string. Here is again an example
input string:</p>

<pre><code>React(generation=0,view=__W_W_W__,energy=100)</code></pre>

<p>Since we'll soon need to extract all of the other parameters as well, the most sensible
way to proceed is to parse the entire parameter list.</p>

            ""
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>The first two line uses <code>split()</code> to break the input into two parts: the opcode and the
remaining line:</p>

<pre><code>val tokens = input.split('(')</code></pre>

<p>These two parts are returned in an array, from which we extract the first
element (index zero) and store it into a local immutable value:</p>

<pre><code>val opcode = tokens(0)</code></pre>

<p>We then test the just-extracted opcode against the &ldquo;React&rdquo; constant:</p>

<pre><code>if(opcode=="React") {</code></pre>

<p>The second element of the <code>tokens</code> array contains the parameters of the command,
plus a trailing closing parenthesis (the opening parenthesis was swallowed by
<code>split()</code>). To obtain a string containing just the comma-separated parameters, we
need to get rid of this trailing character. We do this using the String
method <code>dropRight()</code>, a method available on many collections which takes the
number of elements to drop as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>val rest = tokens(1).dropRight(1)               // "key=value,key=value,key=value"</code></pre>

<p>The <code>rest</code> value now contains a string consisting just of comma-separated key/value
pairs, as shown in the comment on the line above. So we use <code>split()</code> again to break
it apart, this time at occurrences of the comma character:</p>

<pre><code>val params = rest.split(',')                    // = Array("key=value", "key=value", ...)</code></pre>

<p>The result is again an array of <code>String</code> values, each of which has the format
&ldquo;key=value&rdquo;. So now we want to break apart <strong>each one</strong> of these strings using
<code>split()</code> at the equals sign. We achieve this by using <code>map()</code> to process every
element of the array, obtaining a new collection containing the processed
elements:</p>

<pre><code>val strPairs = params.map(s =&gt; s.split('='))    // = Array( Array("key","value"), Array("key","value"), ..)</code></pre>

<p>So <code>strPairs</code> now is an array of arrays of String, with overall type <code>Array[Array[String]]</code>.
For easy lookups later on, we'd really like to have a map from keys to values. Conveniently,
there is the <code>toMap()</code> method that converts a collection of key/value pairs into a map.
Unfortunately, we don't have a collection of pairs but a collection of arrays. So we
process <code>strPairs</code> again to obtain a collection of key/value pairs:</p>

<pre><code>val kvPairs = strPairs.map(a =&gt; (a(0),a(1)))    // = Array( ("key","value"), ("key","value"), ..)</code></pre>

<p>which we then convert into a map:</p>

<pre><code>val paramMap = kvPairs.toMap                         // = Map( "key" -&gt; "value", "key" -&gt; "value", ..)</code></pre>

<p>The value <code>paramMap</code> now contains a reference to an instance of the Scala <code>Map</code>
collection, with type <code>Map[String,String]</code>. Now it is easy to extract the
value associated with the key &ldquo;energy&rdquo; and to convert it from a string into
an integer value:</p>

<pre><code>val energy = paramMap("energy").toInt</code></pre>

<p>And finally we assemble the command string that updates the bot's status message:</p>

<pre><code>"Status(text=Energy:" + energy + ")"</code></pre>

<h3 id = "A_Word_on_Scala_Collections">A Word on Scala Collections</h3>

<p>Scala has a very extensive and very well-designed library that contains a number
of useful collection types, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>List</li>
<li>Set</li>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Queue</li>
</ul>

<p>In many cases, there are two implementations for these collection types: a mutable
and an immutable one. In the mutable variants, operations modify the collection's
contents. In the immutable variants operations return a new, modified collection
without disturbing the original collection.</p>

<p>Scala defaults to immutable collections and for the bot code we will also exclusively
select these immutable collections. Immutability makes it much easier to reason
about our code and to parallelize operations, since we never need to worry about
synchronizing concurrent accesses. In certain performance-critical code sections it
may occasionally be advantageous to internally use a mutable collection with in-place
updating, but this is rarely the case and should be done only if profiling indicates
a need for it. As a rule of thumb, to get the benefits of functional programming we'll
embrace immutability as the default. The Scalatron server and the Scalatron bot
examples exclusively use immutable collections.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the ideas behind immutable collections and other data structures
and want to know more about their time and space characteristics, check out the book
&ldquo;Purely Functional Data Structures&rdquo; by Chris Okasaki.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_dropRight____code__do_">What does <code>dropRight()</code> do?</h3>

<p>Given a collection of elements, we often want to do the same kinds of things with them:
extract elements, drop elements, split the collection, etc. The Scala library provides
implementations for many such operations. If an operation is not present in exactly the
form you need it, in many cases it is still possible to compose existing operations to
achieve your goal.</p>

<p><code>dropRight()</code> is one example of such a collection method. It drops the last N elements
of a collection and returns the resulting new collection. In our bot example:</p>

<pre><code>val rest = tokens(1).dropRight(1)</code></pre>

<p>we apply <code>dropRight()</code> to an instance of <code>String</code>. This works because there is an
implicit conversion from String into a collection type that presents its contents as
an indexed sequence (<code>IndexedSeq</code>) of characters.</p>

<p>In excruciating detail, our code</p>

<pre><code>val rest = tokens(1).dropRight(1)</code></pre>

<p>does this:</p>

<ul>
<li>defines an immutable value 'rest'</li>
<li>takes the element with index 1 in the array of Strings in 'tokens'</li>
<li>this will be the right-hand side of the split, like &ldquo;key=value,key=value)&rdquo;</li>
<li>invokes its method 'dropRight()'</li>
<li>passing the parameter '1' for the number of elements to drop</li>
<li>which returns a value of type 'String' without the closing parenthesis</li>
<li>we can then split the key/value pairs at commas</li>
</ul>

<h3 id = "A_few_useful_collection_methods">A few useful collection methods</h3>

<p>Here are some other frequently used collection methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>head: returns the first element of a collection</li>
<li>last: returns the last element of a collection</li>
<li>tail: drops the first element of a collection and returns the resulting new collection</li>
<li>drop(n): drops the first N elements of the collection and returns the resulting new collection</li>
</ul>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<pre><code>List(1,2,3).drop(2)     // returns List(3)
List(1,2,3).head        // returns 1
List(1,2,3).tail        // returns List(2,3)
List(1,2,3).last        // returns 3</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned, many collection operations also apply to String, treating it as a
collection of <code>Char</code>:</p>

<pre><code>"abc".drop(1)           // returns "bc"
"abc".dropRight(1)      // returns "ab"</code></pre>

<h3 id = "What_does__code__a_0__a_1____code__do_">What does <code>(a(0),a(1))</code> do?</h3>

<p>This expression constructs a pair (a tuple of arity two) containing the first and
second elements of an array value <code>a</code>. We'll talk about where the array comes from
in the next section, and for now focus only on the tuple creation.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, when writing methods, it is often necessary for a function to return
more than one value. Traditionally, for example in Java or C++, this requires the creation
of a parameter object, which involves the definition of a new named type (a class or struct)
and quite a bit of boilerplate code.</p>

<p>Scala already offers a built-in type <code>Tuple</code> with elements whose types are parameterized.
There are implementations for tuples for every arity up to 22. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code>val pair = Tuple2[Int,String](1, "A")
val triple = Tuple3[Int,String,Char](1, "A", 'B')</code></pre>

<p>So instead of defining a new class or struct for a parameter object, we can use a generic
Tuple to return more than one value from a function. Here is an example for a function
declared to return a pair of <code>String</code> values:</p>

<pre><code>def foo : Tuple2[String,String]     // function that returns a tuple</code></pre>

<p>and here is an example implementation:</p>

<pre><code>def foo = new Tuple2[String,String]("Hello", "World")</code></pre>

<p>for which the compiler can infer the types, so we can omit those:</p>

<pre><code>def foo = new Tuple2("Hello", "World")</code></pre>

<p>and because <code>Tuple2</code> offers a static construction method (more on those later), we can
omit the <code>new</code> keyword:</p>

<pre><code>def foo = Tuple2("Hello", "World")</code></pre>

<p>But Scala can do even better than that. Because using <code>Tuple</code> to return values is
so useful and hence used so frequently, Scala has special syntactic sugar to create
tuples and describe tuple types: you simple use parentheses around a comma-separated
list of values or types. Let's do that for our example:</p>

<pre><code>def foo = ("Hello", "World")</code></pre>

<p>Here are some other examples for the use of tuples:</p>

<pre><code>val pair = (1, "A")                     // = Tuple2[Int,String]
val triple = (1, 2, 3)                  // = Tuple3[Int,Int,String]</code></pre>

<p>Scala's syntactic sugar not just helps with creating tuples, it also extends to
declaring tuple types. In the original declaration of our example function <code>foo</code>,
we had:</p>

<pre><code>def foo : Tuple2[String,String]     // function that returns a tuple</code></pre>

<p>Using the tuple syntax we can now write the exact same declaration like this:</p>

<pre><code>def foo : (String,String)           // function that returns a tuple</code></pre>

<p>We can use this wherever a type would appear in Scala:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(pair: (Int, String))        // function accepting Tuple2[Int,String]
def bar: (Int, String)              // function returning Tuple2[Int,String]
val f = () =&gt; (Int, String)         // value: function returning Tuple2[Int,String]</code></pre>

<p>How do you access the contents of a tuple? The tuple implementations in Scala
all contain fields with names like _1, _2, _3, etc. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>val a = ("A","B")._1                    // extracts the first field of the tuple
val b = ("A","B")._2                    // extracts the second field of the tuple</code></pre>

<p>Some more examples for the use of tuples:</p>

<pre><code>val tuple = ("A",2)                             // = Tuple2[String,Int] = (String,Int)
val array = Array("A","B")                      // = Array[String]
val tuple = (array(0),array(1))                 // = Tuple2[String,String] = (String,String)</code></pre>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_map____code__do_">What does <code>map()</code> do?</h3>

<p>The <code>map()</code> method appears in our example twice:</p>

<pre><code>val strPairs = params.map(s =&gt; s.split('='))    // = Array( Array("key","value"), Array("key","value"), ..)
val kvPairs = strPairs.map(a =&gt; (a(0),a(1)))    // = Array( ("key","value"), ("key","value"), ..)</code></pre>

<p>It is a method available on collections (like List, Set, Map) that, given a transformation
function, transforms every element of the collection into a new element and returns a new
collection containing the transformed elements.</p>

<p>It also works for <code>String</code> because <code>String</code> can act as a collection of <code>Char</code>. And,
even though <code>Array</code> in Scala is really just a Java Array which does not extend any of
the neat Scala collection traits, it also works for <code>Array</code> because there is an
implicit conversion that makes it available.</p>

<p>Let's pick apart the two lines that appear in our example in excruciating detail.</p>

<h4 id = "Example_1:">Example 1:</h4>

<pre><code>val strPairs = params.map(s =&gt; s.split('='))</code></pre>

<p>We start by using <code>val</code> to declare an immutable value that will be available in the scope of
our method. We tell the compiler that we will want to access that value by the name <code>strPairs</code>.
We then reference the collection we want to work on, here <code>params</code>, and use the dot-notation
familiar from Java or C++ to invoke the <code>map()</code> method on it.</p>

<p>The <code>map()</code> method takes one parameter, the transformation function.
This has to be a function that takes one parameter (an element of the collection) as its
input and that returns a new value. The type of the parameter must naturally be the type
of the element. The return value can and often will be of a different type. In the example,
the transformation function operates an a collection of <code>String</code> elements and therefore
will take an input parameter of type <code>String</code>. We invoke <code>split()</code> on each of these strings
and therefore convert each element into an <code>Array[String]</code>. Here, the return type of <code>split()</code>
is also the return type of our transformation function. It therefore has the following
type:</p>

<pre><code>String =&gt; Array[String]</code></pre>

<p>i.e. it takes a <code>String</code> parameter and returns an <code>Array[String]</code> value.</p>

<p>The Scala collection library is very clever in how it implements <code>map()</code>. This has the
benefit that you will, whenever possible, get back a collection of the same type as the
one you operated on. Invoking <code>map()</code> on a <code>List</code> will result in a new <code>List</code>, invoking
it on a <code>Set</code> will result in a new <code>Set</code> and invoking it on a <code>Map</code> will result in a
new <code>Map</code>. This is not trivial. The downside is that the type signature of <code>map()</code>
looks scary as hell to people new to Scala. So we won't show it here. But it does what
you expect it to do and you can for now should use it without worrying about the
details. You will have absolutely not problem working out the details once you're more
familiar Scala.</p>

<p>So all that is left for us to do is to somehow tell the compiler that we want the
argument to <code>map()</code> to be an invocation of <code>split()</code> on every element of the collection.
That is what the code in the parentheses after <code>map</code> does:</p>

<pre><code>s =&gt; s.split('=')</code></pre>

<p>Let's first re-write this code using a slightly more verbose but semantically identical
syntax, which we will then explain and show how to get to the simplified version. Here
is the verbose version:</p>

<pre><code>(s: String) =&gt; { s.split('=') }</code></pre>

<p>This defines a function value by specifying, from left to right:</p>

<ul>
<li>the function's input parameter list: <code>(s: String)</code></li>
<li>a symbol that tells the compiler &ldquo;this is a function": <code>=&gt;</code></li>
<li>the body of the function: <code>{ s.split('=') }</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The input parameter list here consist of a single <code>String</code> parameter, to which we assign the
name <code>s</code>. Since the compiler knows the type of the collection on which we invoke <code>map()</code> and
it knows the signature of <code>map()</code>, it can infer the type of the input of our transform
function. It already knows that <code>s</code> will be a <code>String</code>. It therefore allows us to drop the
explicit mention of the type from our function definition. This gives us:</p>

<pre><code>(s) =&gt; { s.split('=') }</code></pre>

<p>Since there is only a single parameter, we can also omit the parentheses. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>s =&gt; { s.split('=') }</code></pre>

<p>Now on the right-hand side of the <code>=&gt;</code> we have the function body. It invokes <code>split()</code>
with the argument <code>s</code>, which obviously contains whatever was passed as the input parameter
to the function; here, consecutively each element of the collection. Since the function
body consists only of a single expression, we can omit the curly braces. This gives us:</p>

<pre><code>s =&gt; s.split('=')</code></pre>

<p>Which is exactly what we have in the example.</p>

<p>Scala allows us to express this even more concisely, however. We did not use this in the
example above to keep things simple to start with, but you can now try this out right away.
Essentially, it is very common for functions like the one we're passing to <code>map()</code> to
reference their parameters exactly once, for example to invoke a method on them. In instances
where this is the case, there is really no need to assign a name to the parameter - better
to keep it short. Scala allows us to make such an &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; reference to a parameter by
using an underscore. So we can actually rewrite the example code like this:</p>

<pre><code>val strPairs = params.map(_.split('='))</code></pre>

<p>When the <code>map()</code> method is executed at run time, it will iterate over the collection
elements of <code>params</code> and invoke <code>split('=')</code> on each one. This generates a new collection
containing elements of type <code>Array[String]</code>, which is then available through the value
<code>strPairs</code>. So when we start, <code>params</code> might contain the following value:</p>

<pre><code>Array("a=b", "c=d", "e=f")</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards, <code>strPairs</code> would contain the following value:</p>

<pre><code>Array(Array("a", "b"), Array("c", "d"), Array("e", "f"))</code></pre>

<h4 id = "Example_2:">Example 2:</h4>

<pre><code>val kvPairs = strPairs.map(a =&gt; (a(0),a(1)))</code></pre>

<p>The intent is to convert the array of arrays of strings into an array of pairs of strings,
so that we can then turn it into a map using <code>toMap()</code>. This is achieved by invoking the
<code>map()</code> method on <code>strPairs</code>, which has type <code>Array[Array[String]]</code>, and using a transform
function that turns each element of the collection (which will be an <code>Array[String]</code> that
was returned by <code>split()</code>, see above) into a pair of strings. Here is the transform
function in isolation:</p>

<pre><code>a =&gt; (a(0),a(1))</code></pre>

<p>This is the concise equivalent of a more verbose version, like what we had in the
previous example:</p>

<pre><code>(a: Array[String]) =&gt; { (a(0),a(1)) }</code></pre>

<p>Which would be even more verbose if we did not have the syntactic sugar for tuple creation
and type inference for the tuple's parameter types:</p>

<pre><code>(a: Array[String]) =&gt; { new Tuple2[String,String](a(0), a(1)) }</code></pre>

<p>Just think for a moment about the amount of boilerplate code you'd have to write to
do this in whatever language you are using now, the time it takes to type all that
stuff in and the opportunity for introducing errors that generates.</p>

<h3 id = "Wrapping_up">Wrapping up</h3>

<p>The example uses a lot of named values to clarify the meaning of each computational
step. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>val rest = tokens(1).dropRight(1)               // "key=value,key=value,key=value"
val params = rest.split(',')                    // = Array("key=value", "key=value", ...)
val strPairs = params.map(s =&gt; s.split('='))    // = Array( Array("key","value"), Array("key","value"), ..)
val kvPairs = strPairs.map(a =&gt; (a(0),a(1)))    // = Array( ("key","value"), ("key","value"), ..)
val paramMap = kvPairs.toMap                    // = Map( "key" -&gt; "value", "key" -&gt; "value", ..)</code></pre>

<p>We could of course draw all this together into a single invocation chain. The
result would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>val paramMap =
    tokens(1)
    .dropRight(1)
    .split(',')
    .map(_.split('='))
    .map(a =&gt; (a(0),a(1)))
    .toMap</code></pre>

<p>and the entire control function would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String) = {
    val tokens = input.split('(')
    val opcode = tokens(0)
    if(opcode=="React") {
        val paramMap =
            tokens(1).dropRight(1).split(',').map(_.split('='))
            .map(a =&gt; (a(0), a(1))).toMap
        val energy = paramMap("energy").toInt
        "Status(text=Energy:" + energy + ")"
    } else {
        ""
    }
}</code></pre>

<h3 id = "More_on_Scala_Maps">More on Scala Maps</h3>

<p>Like for most collection types, there are mutable and immutable versions of <code>Map</code>.
Here are a few more examples of how to create a map and work with its contents:</p>

<pre><code>    val map = Map("A" -&gt; 1, "B" -&gt; 2, "C" -&gt; 3)     // = Map[String,Int]

    val tuples = Array( ("A",1), ("B",2), ("C",3) ) // = Array[(String,Int)]

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>The code in the <code>respond()</code> method should by now be obvious. The primary change is that
instead of parsing the input string locally, we invoke a newly defined function <code>parse()</code>.</p>

<p>The parse function is defined within the body of our <code>ControlFunction</code> class, which makes it a
method with access to the <code>ControlFunction</code> instance (via <code>this</code>) - something we do not really
need here. It could just as well be a static function. In the next example we will
make this change, but for now let's look at the method as it stands.</p>

<h3 id = "What_is_the_Return_Type_of__code_parse____code__">What is the Return Type of <code>parse()</code>?</h3>

<p>We might note that in the first line of the method definition</p>

<pre><code>def parse(command: String) = {</code></pre>

<p>no return type is specified. The <code>=</code> indicates to the compiler that a value will be
returned, but we leave it up to the compiler to figure out what the return type is.
After looking at the method definition (which we'll also do in just a minute) the
compiler will infer it to be:</p>

<pre><code>(String, Map[String, String])</code></pre>

<p>i.e. a tuple (pair) containing a <code>String</code> as well as a <code>Map</code> from <code>String</code> to <code>String</code>.
In the first element of the tuple <code>parse()</code> will return the opcode of the command.
In the second element it will return the parameter map. Its keys are the parameter
names and its values are the parameter values.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what the <code>parse()</code> method expects as its input:</p>

<pre><code>"React(generation=0,energy=100)"</code></pre>

<p>and what it will return:</p>

<pre><code>("React", Map( "generation" -&gt; "0", "energy" -&gt; "100") )</code></pre>

<h3 id = "Why_is_there_a__code_def__code__in_the_body_of__code_parse____code__">Why is there a <code>def</code> in the body of <code>parse()</code>?</h3>

<p>To structure our parsing code, we use a local helper function <code>splitParam()</code> to
break apart the individual key/value pairs. Since this helper function is not
used or useful anywhere else in our code, we can keep it private to the method
that needs it. Scala allows us to nest functions as deeply as we want, so we
simply defined <code>splitParam()</code> within <code>parse()</code>, keeping the symbol local to
the function.</p>

<h3 id = "Can_my_Bot_just_throw_an_exception_">Can my Bot just throw an exception?</h3>

<p>Yes. The Scalatron game server will catch and process all exceptions thrown
within the bots. It also won't send you any invalid commands, but knowing how
to validate your inputs and how to throw an exception is useful.</p>

<p>When an exception is thrown, just as in Java, control escalates up the call
stack to the nearest exception handler. This is an instance where no value
is returned from a function.</p>

<p>Actually, just for reference, here is how you catch an exception in Scala:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    ... code that might throw an exception...
} catch {
    case e: Exception =&gt; ... code that handles the exception ...
}</code></pre>

<p>The code within the <code>catch</code> block uses pattern matching, a powerful feature
that we will look at later on.</p>

<p>Note that the entire code block above is also an expression. If no exception
is thrown, it yields the value of the code within the <code>try</code> block. If an
exception is thrown, it yields the value of the exception handler.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_map_splitParam___code__do_">What does <code>map(splitParam)</code> do?</h3>

<p>It is another example of syntactic sugar offered by Scala to eliminate
boilerplate and make your code more concise. The full line in the example
reads:</p>

<pre><code>val keyValuePairs = params.map( splitParam ).toMap</code></pre>

<p>We already looked at how <code>map()</code> works: it expects a transformation function
as its only parameter. Here, the transformation function is obviously <code>splitParams</code>,
the local function we defined to take apart the key/value pairs. But the syntax
we use here is new: it contains neither a named parameter nor an underscore as an
anonymous placeholder. Instead, it exploits the fact that - in the frequently
occurring case of a function whose body is simply another function that takes the
input parameter of the outer function as its parameter - we can omit the parameter
altogether. The verbose variant of the line above would be:</p>

<pre><code>val keyValuePairs = params.map(s =&gt; splitParam(s)).toMap</code></pre>

method. So let's turn it into one.</p>

        (segments(0), keyValuePairs)
    }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>The code above uses the keyword <code>object</code> to define a container for our static parser function
(more on <code>object</code> below). The container gets the name <code>CommandParser</code> and it contains a static
method <code>apply()</code>, which is simply a renamed copy of our former <code>parse()</code> function. And the
method body of <code>respond()</code> invokes the static parsing function via a reference to the
<code>CommandParser</code> object. Here you should note the absence of an explicit mention of <code>apply()</code>
in the invocation and the way the parsed result is broken up into two values in parentheses -
both of which we'll explain below.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_object__code__do_">What does <code>object</code> do?</h3>

<p>The <code>object</code> keyword in Scala defines a container for static values and methods. Unlike
Java, where static fields and methods are mixed into the regular methods of a <code>class</code>, Scala
isolates static methods into such containers.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how you might use <code>object</code>:</p>

<pre><code>object BotConstants {
    val energyThreshold = 100
    val spawnDelay = 10
}</code></pre>

<p>and here is how code elsewhere could access these static values:</p>

<pre><code>class FooBar {
    def foo() {
        bar(BotConstants.energyThreshold)
        blop(BotConstants.spawnDelay)
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>An important concept in this context is that of a <strong>companion object</strong> for a <code>class</code>.
A companion object is a container for the static methods of a class that has the same
name as the class and that is defined in the same <code>.scala</code> file.</p>

<h3 id = "Why_is_there_no_explicit_call_to__code_apply____code__">Why is there no explicit call to <code>apply()</code>?</h3>

<p>In the bot example code, we have the following line:</p>

<pre><code>val (opcode, paramMap) = CommandParser(input)</code></pre>

<p>We now know that <code>CommandParser</code> refers to a container for static functions and values.
And evidently the code is intended to parse the input. But the parser function has the
name <code>apply()</code> and there is no mention of <code>apply()</code> here. What is going on?</p>

<p>In Scala, methods called <code>apply()</code> have special meaning. The most immediate practical
consequence is that for methods and functions whose name is <code>apply</code> you can omit the
method name and use just parentheses and the parameters. So the verbose variant of the
invocation above would be:</p>

<pre><code>val (opcode, paramMap) = CommandParser.apply(input)</code></pre>

<p>We simply omitted the dot and the <code>apply</code> method name, because we do not need it.
You'll see various uses of this hand syntax later on, which will in many scenarios
make your code look much more readable and elegant (once you've figured out what
is going on, of course).</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_paramMap__energy____code__do_">What does <code>paramMap("energy")</code> do?</h3>

<p>The complete line of code in our bot example is:</p>

<pre><code>"Status(text=Energy:" + paramMap("energy") + ")"</code></pre>

<p>Overall this is a string concatenation in which the symbol <code>paramMap</code> refers to the
parameter map returned by the command parser, i.e. it is a reference to an instance of
a <code>Map[String,String]</code> whose keys are the parameter names and whose values are the
parameter values.</p>

<p>So we can already anticipate that this code will retrieve the value associated with
the key &ldquo;energy&rdquo;. But why is this a valid method invocation, if we have an instance
but no dot or method?</p>

<p>The solution is the same as for the code that we used to parse the command string:
it is an invocation of a method of <code>Map</code> called <code>apply()</code>, in which Scala allows us
to omit the method name. The verbose variant would be this:</p>

<pre><code>"Status(text=Energy:" + paramMap.apply("energy") + ")"</code></pre>

<h3 id = "What_does__code__opcode__paramMap___code__do_">What does <code>(opcode, paramMap)</code> do?</h3>

<p>So we know that <code>parse()</code> returns a tuple that Scala generates for us on the fly.
In the preceding example, we have used the following code to take apart the tuple
and obtain the individual element values:</p>

<pre><code>val parseResult = parse(input)
val opcode = parseResult._1
val paramMap = parseResult._2</code></pre>

<p>Now, the code just reads</p>

<pre><code>val (opcode, paramMap) = CommandParser(input)</code></pre>

<p>How does this work?</p>

<p>We already noted that the need for functions with multiple return values is
common and prompted the Scala designers to offer some syntactic sugar for
constructing and typing <code>Tuple</code> values. To complete the cycle, Scala also
offers syntactic sugar for taking the results apart again at the call site,
some of which is specific to <code>Tuple</code> and some is not.</p>

<p>The details are beyond what is required here, but the gist of the code above 
is this: Scala breaks the returned tuple up into its elements and assigns
the element values to the local values <code>opcode</code> and <code>paramMap</code>. </p>

<p>If you want to read up on the concepts related to this extremely powerful
idea, look up &ldquo;extractors&rdquo; and &ldquo;unapply&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Programming in Scala&rdquo; book.</p>

<h2 id = "Source_Code">Source Code</h2>

<p>We will from now on omit the code for the <code>CommandParser</code> object, since we will never
again change it. Just leave it in your source file, just like we did with the
<code>ControlFunctionFactory</code> class.</p>

<pre><code>import util.Random

class ControlFunction {
    val rnd = new Random()
    def respond(input: String): String = {
        val (opcode, paramMap) = CommandParser(input)

        } else {
            ""
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>In the first line, we add an <code>import</code> statement that will pull in the definition of the
<code>scala.util.Random</code> class, a pseudo-random number generator (actually a Scala wrapper for
<code>java.util.Random</code>):</p>

<pre><code>import util.Random</code></pre>

<p>This makes the symbol <code>Random</code> available to the code in our source file.</p>

<p>We then add a new field called <code>rnd</code> to our <code>ControlFunction</code> class which will hold a reference to an
instance of such a pseudo-random number generator, which we simply create with <code>new</code>:</p>

<pre><code>val rnd = new Random()</code></pre>

<p>Further down, we use the generator to produce random X and Y values for the movement
direction of our bot:</p>

<pre><code>val dx = rnd.nextInt(3)-1
val dy = rnd.nextInt(3)-1</code></pre>

<p>This code uses the member function <code>nextInt(n: Int)</code> of <code>Random</code>, which returns a 
value in the range <code>0</code> to <code>(n-1)</code>. </p>

<p>We then combine the generated coordinate values with the Scalatron command opcode 
<code>Move</code> (see the Scalatron Protocol documentation) to assemble the bot's response:</p>

<pre><code>"Move(direction=" + dx + ":" + dy + ")"</code></pre>

<p>The result is a bot that, every time it is asked by the game server what it wants to do,
requests the be moved once cell in some random direction.</p>

                "Move(direction=" + heading + ")"
            }
        } else ""
    }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>Much of the code is identical to the previous version: we define a field for a random
number generator and we parse the input command.</p>

<p>But then the code differentiates between the <code>generation</code> of the entity for which the control
function is invoked. To do that, the code extracts the value of the <code>generation</code> parameter from
the parameter map. Master bots have <code>generation</code> 0 (zero), while mini-bots have <code>generation</code>
1 (one) or higher. The game server provides this parameter to indicate to our control function
for which of the controlled entities it wants a response.</p>

<pre><code>val generation = paramMap("generation").toInt</code></pre>

<p>The master bot will always see this value as 0 (zero), but mini-bots that we spawned will see
a 1 (one). So we can follow this with an <code>if</code> expression:</p>

<pre><code>if( generation == 0 ) {</code></pre>

<p>In the true-block, we have the code for our master bot. It checks whether the bot has
enough energy to spawn a mini-bot by checking the &ldquo;energy&rdquo; parameter passed by the game
server:</p>

<pre><code>if( paramMap("energy").toInt &gt;= 100 /* ... */ ) {</code></pre>

<p>And we use the random number generator to express that we want to launch a new missile
each cycle we're invoked with a probability of 5%:</p>

<pre><code>if( /* ... */ rnd.nextDouble() &lt; 0.05 ) {</code></pre>

<p>We then assemble a random launch direction for the missile:</p>

<pre><code>val dx = rnd.nextInt(3)-1
val dy = rnd.nextInt(3)-1</code></pre>

<p>and use the X and Y direction values to construct a string direction:</p>

<pre><code>val direction = dx + ":" + dy // e.g. "-1:1"</code></pre>

<p>We will use this string as we concatenate and return a command string that tells the game
server to spawn a new mini-bot at the given offset (relative to the master bot):</p>

<pre><code>"Spawn(direction=" + direction + ",energy=100,heading=" + direction + ")"</code></pre>

<p>But in addition to specifying the <code>direction</code> and <code>energy</code> parameters that are defined for
the <code>Spawn</code> opcode in the server/plug-in protocol, we're passing a custom state parameter
called <code>heading</code>. In doing so we exploit the fact that the server lets us use the <code>Spawn</code>
to initialize the state property of the new mini-bot with arbitrary additional values before
it is brought into existence in the arena.</p>

<p>In the false-block, we have the code for the case where the control function is invoked for any
of the mini-bots we spawned. The mini-bot needs to know in which direction to move. That is
where the custom state property <code>heading</code> comes into play which we initialized with <code>Spawn</code>.
The mini-bot fetches this property's value and uses it as its movement direction:</p>

<pre><code>val heading = paramMap("heading")
"Move(direction=" + heading + ")"</code></pre>

<p>Since we already stored the <code>heading</code> in the format appropriate for x/y coordinate values
("x:y&rdquo;), we can simply pass the string value of the property as the direction of the <code>Move</code>
command.</p>

<h1 id = "Bot__9:_Missile_Launcher_II">Bot #9: Missile Launcher II</h1>

<h2 id = "Objective">Objective</h2>

<p>The missile launcher in the preceding section was the second bot variant in which 
we had to work with X/Y coordinates. Obviously, for a bot navigating a two-dimensional environment,
there'll be a lot more of this. So we will write a little class that makes dealing 
with such X/Y coordinates more convenient.</p>

<p>Departing from the style of the preceding examples for a moment we will not present
the entire source code up front but rather develop it in several steps.</p>

<h2 id = "Step_1:_using__Tuple_">Step 1: using 'Tuple'</h2>

<p>Since we already know about <code>Tuple</code> and constructing tuples with Scala is so
convenient, we might start out without introducing our own type and simply
work with <code>Tuple2</code>. The only code we have so far for working with X/Y coordinates
simply generates a random coordinate using an instance of a random number generator:</p>

<pre><code>val dx = rnd.nextInt(3)-1
val dy = rnd.nextInt(3)-1
val direction = dx + ":" + dy // e.g. "-1:1"
"Spawn(direction=" + direction + ",heading=" + direction + ")"</code></pre>

<p>Note that we're omitting the <code>energy</code> parameter; the server will then simply use the
minimum spawn-energy value (100 EU) as a default.</p>

<p>Let's define a method that constructs a tuple instead of two separate values:</p>

<pre><code>def random() = (rnd.nextInt(3)-1, rnd.nextInt(3)-1)</code></pre>

<p>We could then rewrite our code as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def random() = (rnd.nextInt(3)-1, rnd.nextInt(3)-1)
val xy = random()
val direction = xy._1 + ":" + xy._2 // e.g. "-1:1"
"Spawn(direction=" + direction + ",heading=" + direction + ")"</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Detour:_parentheses_on_methods_with_no_arguments">Detour: parentheses on methods with no arguments</h2>

<p>Just a very brief detour to talk about parentheses on invocations of methods that
take no parameters, like <code>random()</code> above: the convention in Scala is to omit the
parentheses if the method <strong>has no</strong> side effects, i.e. does not change any state (in
most cases this means it does nothing beyond computing and returning a value). If 
the method <strong>has</strong> side effects, we'll signal that by declaring and invoking it with 
empty parentheses, as we do above.</p>

<p>Why does the method have side effects, even though it looks like it just computes
and returns a value? Well, invoking <code>nextInt(n)</code> changes the internal state of
the randomizer, and this is a side effect of invoking our <code>random()</code> method. That
is why we declared it with parentheses.</p>

<h2 id = "Step_2:_moving_construction_to_an__code_object__code_">Step 2: moving construction to an <code>object</code></h2>

<p>If the construction of pairs holding random values would be accessed from several
call sites in our code, we'd have to supply the random number generator as a parameter
instead of silently accessing the one in the surrounding object instance. Like this</p>

<pre><code>def random(rnd: Random) = (rnd.nextInt(3)-1, rnd.nextInt(3)-1)</code></pre>

<p>But now we have no reference to the <code>this</code> context at all, and the method could exist
as a static factory function. To get a static function, we need an <code>object</code>, so let's
define one:</p>

<pre><code>object XY {
    def random(rnd: Random) = (rnd.nextInt(3)-1, rnd.nextInt(3)-1)
}</code></pre>

<p>We can then update the code fragment within the <code>ControlFunction</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val xy = XY.random(rnd)
val direction = xy._1 + ":" + xy._2 // e.g. "-1:1"
"Spawn(direction=" + direction + ",heading=" + direction + ")"</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Step_3:_creating_our_own_class">Step 3: creating our own class</h2>

<p>Now what if we wanted to transform an X/Y coordinate instance, for example by adding
another X/Y value as an offset? We could extend <code>Tuple2</code> and add methods to it, but
that is inadvisable for both technical reasons (<code>Tuple2</code> is a <code>case class</code>, more on
those soon) and because we prefer composition over inheritance. We could also do some
fancy footwork and provide new methods for the existing <code>Tuple2</code> type (using Scala's
&ldquo;pimp my library&rdquo; approach), but that's not really called for if we expect to add a
lot of methods.</p>

<p>No, the natural path here is to define our own <code>class</code>, just like we would in Java:</p>

<pre><code>class XY(val x: Int, val y: Int)</code></pre>

<p>which is roughly equivalent to the following Java code:</p>

<pre><code>class XY {
    final int x;
    final int y;

    XY(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>We can now instantiate values of this class and like this:</p>

<pre><code>val xy = new XY(1, 1)</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Step_4:_adding_a_member_function">Step 4: adding a member function</h2>

<p>Let's add a method called <code>add</code> that will add the x and y fields of a given
<code>XY</code> instance to those of the current one:</p>

<pre><code>class XY(val x: Int, val y: Int) {
    def add(other: XY) = new XY(x+other.x, y+other.y)
}</code></pre>

<p>We can use this method as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val xy1 = new XY(1, 1)
val xy2 = new XY(2, 2)
val xy3 = xy1.add(xy2)</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that we're striving for immutability, i.e. methods like <code>add()</code>
will always return a new instance rather than modifying the existing instance.</p>

<p>In Scala, we can call our method almost whatever we want, including the naturally
attractive <code>+</code>, so we'll use that:</p>

<pre><code>class XY(val x: Int, val y: Int) {
    def +(other: XY) = new XY(x+other.x, y+other.y)
}</code></pre>

<p>and use it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val xy1 = new XY(1, 1)
val xy2 = new XY(2, 2)
val xy3 = xy1 + xy2</code></pre>

<p>As a side note, the ability to create methods that look like operators leads a lot
of programmers to define methods that look like operators, resulting in libraries
that define lots of methods that look like operators and are consequently completely 
incomprehensible to anybody who does not know the operator symbols. Don't be put off
by this, though: soon enough you'll know all the operator symbols you frequently use
and will know how to look up the others. And you'll probably join the crowd of 
programmers defining lots of methods that look like operators, although an argument
could be made that code with short symbols is not necessarily better code.</p>

<h2 id = "Step_5:_creating_a_factory_function">Step 5: creating a factory function</h2>

<p>Let's assemble the code we have so far:</p>

<pre><code>class XY(val x: Int, val y: Int) {
    def +(other: XY) = new XY(x+other.x, y+other.y)
}
object XY {
    def random(rnd: Random) = new XY(rnd.nextInt(3)-1, rnd.nextInt(3)-1)
}</code></pre>

<p>We have a <code>class</code> definition with a <code>+</code> method and a companion <code>object</code> with a
<code>random()</code> factory function. Using the <code>new</code> keyword, we can construct class instances
and using the factory methods we can generate random instances. Now, we know of the
syntactic sugar we get with methods called <code>apply()</code>, so why don't we add one:</p>

<pre><code>...
object XY {
    def apply(x: Int, y: Int) = new XY(x, y)
    def random(rnd: Random) = XY(rnd.nextInt(3)-1, rnd.nextInt(3)-1)
}</code></pre>

<p>Now, instead of littering our code with <code>new XY(x,y)</code> we can say just <code>XY(x, y)</code> to 
construct <code>XY</code> instances:</p>

<pre><code>val xy3 = XY(1, 1) + XY(2, 2)</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Step_6:_upgrading_to_a__code_case_class__code_">Step 6: upgrading to a <code>case class</code></h2>

<p>Next, we'll &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; our class definition to a <code>case class</code>:</p>

<pre><code>case class XY(x: Int, y: Int)</code></pre>

<p>The modifier keyword <code>case</code> before the <code>class</code> keyword basically instructs the compiler:
&ldquo;add all the stuff to my class that a sane person will usually want&rdquo;. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>an immutable field for each parameter of the <code>class</code> definition <br/></li>
<li>an <code>equals()</code> method that tests equality by checking each field</li>
<li>a <code>hashCode</code> method that takes into account each field</li>
<li>a <code>toString</code> method that takes into account each field</li>
</ul>

<p>as well as a few others. Upgrading a <code>class</code> to a <code>case class</code> also automatically 
generates a companion object of the same name with an <code>apply()</code> function as a 
factory function that takes the parameters of the <code>class</code> as its arguments. The
new code in its entirety looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>case class XY(x: Int, y: Int) {
    def +(other: XY) = XY(x+other.x, y+other.y)
}
object XY {
    def random(rnd: Random) = XY(rnd.nextInt(3)-1, rnd.nextInt(3)-1)
}</code></pre>

<p>Where our hand-coded <code>apply()</code> was removed from the definition of <code>object XY</code>
because the compiler now generates it automatically for us at compile time.</p>

<p>We can now do stuff like this:</p>

<pre><code>assert(XY(1,1) == XY(1,1))
assert(XY(1,1) != XY(2,2))
assert(XY(1,1).hashCode == XY(1,1).hashCode)
assert(XY(1,1).toString == "XY(1,1)")
assert(XY(1,1) + XY(2,2) = XY(3,3))</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Step_7:_adding_a_few_other_methods">Step 7: adding a few other methods</h2>

<p>We can add methods like the following to our <code>class</code>:</p>

<pre><code>case class XY(x: Int, y: Int) {
    // ...
    def isNonZero = x!=0 || y!=0
    def isZero = x==0 &amp;&amp; y==0
    def isNonNegative = x&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; y&gt;=0

    def updateX(newX: Int) = XY(newX, y)
    def updateY(newY: Int) = XY(x, newY)

    def addToX(dx: Int) = XY(x+dx, y)
    def addToY(dy: Int) = XY(x, y+dy)

    def +(pos: XY) = XY(x+pos.x, y+pos.y)
    def -(pos: XY) = XY(x-pos.x, y-pos.y)
    def *(factor: Double) = XY((x*factor).intValue, (y*factor).intValue)

    def distanceTo(pos: XY) : Double = (this-pos).length
    def length : Double = math.sqrt(x*x + y*y)

    def signum = XY(x.signum, y.signum)

    def negate = XY(-x, -y)
    def negateX = XY(-x, y)
    def negateY = XY(x, -y)
}</code></pre>

<p>And we can expand out static code in <code>object</code> as well:</p>

<pre><code>object XY {
    val Zero = XY(0,0)
    val One =  XY(1,1)

    val Right      = XY( 1,  0)
    val RightUp    = XY( 1, -1)
    val Up         = XY( 0, -1)
    val UpLeft     = XY(-1, -1)
    val Left       = XY(-1,  0)
    val LeftDown   = XY(-1,  1)
    val Down       = XY( 0,  1)
    val DownRight  = XY( 1,  1)
}</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Step_8:_the_modified_bot">Step 8: the modified bot</h2>

<p>Using the <code>XY</code> class we just defined, we can update our bot's <code>respond()</code> method as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String): String = {
    val (opcode, paramMap) = CommandParser(input)
    if( opcode == "React" ) {
        val generation = paramMap("generation").toInt
        if( generation == 0 ) {
            if( paramMap("energy").toInt &gt;= 100 &amp;&amp; rnd.nextDouble() &lt; 0.05 ) {
                val heading = XY.random(rnd)
                val headingStr = heading.x + ":" + heading.y // e.g. "-1:1"
                "Spawn(direction=" + headingStr + ",heading=" + headingStr + ")"
            } else ""
        } else {
            val headingStr = paramMap("heading")
            val directions = headingStr.split(':').map(_.toInt) // e.g. "-1:1" =&gt; Array(-1,1)
            "Move(direction=" + directions(0) + ":" + directions(1) + ")"
        }
    } else ""
}</code></pre>

<p>We notice that we could also shift the encoding and decoding of the <code>heading</code> state parameter
into the <code>XY</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>case class XY(x: Int, y: Int) {
    // ...
    override def toString = x + ":" + y
}

object XY {
    // ...
    def fromString(s: String) = {
        val xy = s.split(':').map(_.toInt) // e.g. "-1:1" =&gt; Array(-1,1)
        XY(xy(0), xy(1))
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Note the <code>override</code> modifier on the definition of <code>toString</code>. In Scala, overriding a method
that is already defined in a base class or trait requires this modifier in order to keep
you from inadvertently overriding a parent method you may not even have noticed was there,
thus changing the behavior of the code in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>We then obtain the almost-final variant of our <code>respond()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String): String = {
    val (opcode, paramMap) = CommandParser(input)
    if( opcode == "React" ) {
        val generation = paramMap("generation").toInt
        if( generation == 0 ) {
            if( paramMap("energy").toInt &gt;= 100 &amp;&amp; rnd.nextDouble() &lt; 0.05 ) {
                val heading = XY.random(rnd)
                "Spawn(direction=" + heading + ",heading=" + heading + ")"
            } else ""
        } else {
            val headingStr = paramMap("heading")
            val heading = XY.fromString(headingStr)
            "Move(direction=" + heading + ")"
        }
    } else ""
}</code></pre>

<p>Note that in the construction of the <code>Spawn</code> and <code>Move</code> response strings, we are not explicitly
calling <code>XY.toString</code>. The compiler detects that, in order to assemble the concatenated values
into a string, it needs to convert our <code>direction</code> values from type <code>XY</code> into type <code>String</code>
and automatically inserts calls to <code>XY.toString</code> to accomplish that.</p>

<h2 id = "Step_9:_changing__code_fromString__code__to__code_apply__code_">Step 9: changing <code>fromString</code> to <code>apply</code></h2>

<p>The static method <code>XY.fromString()</code> is essentially a factory method that, instead of <code>Int</code> x and y
coordinates, takes a specially formatted <code>String</code> value as a parameter. So it makes sense to also
define an <code>apply()</code> function on <code>object XY</code>:</p>

<pre><code>object XY {
    def apply(s: String) : XY = {
        val xy = s.split(':').map(_.toInt) // e.g. "-1:1" =&gt; Array(-1,1)
        XY(xy(0), xy(1))
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>As before, because the function is overloaded, we need to declare the return value explicitly to
be of type <code>XY</code>.</p>

<p>After making this change, we can change the earlier code:</p>

<pre><code>val heading = XY.fromString(headingStr)</code></pre>

<p>into this slightly more concise format:</p>

<pre><code>val heading = XY(headingStr)</code></pre>

<h1 id = "Bot__10:_Food_Finder">Bot #10: Food Finder</h1>

<h2 id = "Objective">Objective</h2>

<p>The bot for the first time examines its surroundings, searches for the nearest food item
(edible plant), runs towards it and eats it. To realize this, we need to examine the
string value the server passes to the control function in the &ldquo;view&rdquo; parameter. The string
looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>WWWWWWWW_____WW_____WW__M__WW_____WW____PWWWWWWWW</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is a simplified version; the actual string sent by the game server will
contain a larger view and will be be much longer. The size of the &ldquo;view&rdquo; string is described
in detail in the document <strong>Scalatron Game Rules</strong>.</p>

<p>The string has a very simple structure: it is a cell-by-cell rendering of the surroundings
of the bot into an ASCII string. Every letter in the string corresponds to a cell on the
game board. The view is always square and its edges span an odd number of cells.</p>

<p>The example string above contains 49 characters, leading us to deduce that it is a
rendering of a 7x7 square of cells. Each letter corresponds to a game entity. If we
break the view into multiple lines by fragmenting it at every 7th letter, we obtain:</p>

<pre><code>WWWWWWW
W_____W
W_____W
W__M__W
W_____W
W____PW
WWWWWWW</code></pre>

<p>The game entity character codes are described in detail in the document <strong>Scalatron Protocol</strong>.
Here is an excerpt:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;_&rdquo; empty cell</li>
<li>&ldquo;W&rdquo; wall</li>
<li>&ldquo;M&rdquo; Bot (=master; yours, always in the center unless seen by a slave)</li>
<li>&ldquo;P&rdquo; Zugar (=good plant, food)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what the bot observes in the example is:</p>

<ul>
<li>the view is completely surrounded by wall blocks (<code>W</code>)</li>
<li>the bot itself resides exactly at the center (<code>M</code>)</li>
<li>at the bottom right there is an edible plant (<code>P</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this string, the bot now needs to find the nearest food item and move towards it.
We'll again develop the code to achieve this in several steps.</p>

<h2 id = "Step__1:_a_view_parser_class">Step #1: a view parser class</h2>

<p>Obviously, in a programming game in which bots must react to what they see in the game,
there'll be a lot of view parsing and analyzing. So we anticipate that we'll benefit from
having a smarter representation of the view string than a sequence of ASCII characters.
Since the view won't change while we work on it each cycle, a simple solution would be to
just wrap the string and add whatever fields and methods we may want:</p>

<pre><code>case class View(cells: String)</code></pre>

<p>To access the cell at a particular index, we can provide an <code>apply()</code> method, like this:</p>

<pre><code>case class View(cells: String) {
    def apply(index: Int) = cells.charAt(index)
}</code></pre>

<p>We could use this code in our control function as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val viewString = paramMap("view")
val view = View(viewString)
val cell = view(10)</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Step__2:_XY_cell_access">Step #2: XY cell access</h2>

<p>However, we'll want to mostly access cells using <code>XY</code> coordinates, via the 2D integer vector
class we just defined in the preceding chapter. To do that, we need a method that translates
<code>XY</code> coordinates into indices, like so:</p>

<pre><code>def indexFromAbsPos(absPos: XY) = absPos.x + absPos.y * size</code></pre>

<p>We refer to this addressing scheme as using &ldquo;absolute positions&rdquo; since the <code>XY</code> value
is relative to the top-left corner of the view. We'll look at positioning relative to
the bot's location shortly.</p>

<p>However, the absolute position to index translation code relies on an as-yet-undefined
value <code>size</code>, which contains the number of cells per line. We could compute this on-the-fly
of course by defining a method <code>size</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def size = math.sqrt(cells.length).intValue</code></pre>

<p>But since this method would be called <em>a lot</em> we probably want to cache the value. So we
could convert the definition from a method into an immutable field, which would be
initialized at construction time:</p>

<pre><code>val size = math.sqrt(cells.length).intValue</code></pre>

<p>The <code>View</code> class now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>case class View(cells: String) {
    val size = math.sqrt(cells.length).intValue
    def indexFromAbsPos(absPos: XY) = absPos.x + absPos.y * size
    def apply(absPos: XY) = cells.charAt(indexFromAbsPos(absPos))
}</code></pre>

<p>We can now construct and use <code>View</code> instances as follows:</p>

<pre><code>val viewString = paramMap("view")
val view = View(viewString)
val cell = view(XY(1,1))</code></pre>

<h3 id = "Detour:_class_parameter_versus_field">Detour: class parameter versus field</h3>

<p>As a quick detour, let's examine an alternative implementation. Why not shift the <code>size</code>
field into the <code>case class</code> parameter list at the top and provide a factory method that
computes this value up front? Like so:</p>

<pre><code>object View {
    def apply(view: String): View = View(math.sqrt(view.length).toInt, view)
}
case class View(size: Int, cells: String) {
    def indexFromAbsPos(absPos: XY) = absPos.x + absPos.y * size
    def apply(absPos: XY) = cells.charAt(indexFromAbsPos(absPos))
}</code></pre>

<p>Note that here, the Scala compiler requires that we specify the return type of the <code>apply()</code>
method because the method is overloaded. How is it overloaded even though there is only one
variant here? Well, we defined <code>View</code> as a <code>case class</code>, so the compiler automatically
generates an <code>apply()</code> method for the parameters of the class at compile time, which is
not visible for us in the source code. For overloaded functions, Scala requires an
explicitly specified return type, which we therefore specify here. The reason we add another
<code>apply()</code> function is that it allows users of the <code>View</code> class to omit the <code>size</code> parameter
now expected by the auto-generated <code>apply()</code>.</p>

<p>But would this even be a good alternative? It would certainly work, but recalling that
using a <code>case class</code> also generates implementations of <code>toString</code>, <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code>
for us that are based on the class parameter list, we'd now burden each one with the <code>size</code>
parameter which really is redundant: for equality or hashing we only need the string. So
while this solution is possible, it is here better to leave <code>size</code> as a field that is
defined within the class body, more like a class-local constant value.</p>

<h2 id = "Step__3:_relative_addressing">Step #3: relative addressing</h2>

<p>Absolute addressing (relative to top-left of the view) is useful, but eventually we'll
always want to guide a bot to some location, and the game server expects all movement commands
to contain offsets relative to the bot position. So a very common use case is relative
addressing, where we supply and receive coordinates relative to the center of the view
(where the bot resides).</p>

<p>So we'll expand the <code>View</code> class with relative addressing, modify the <code>apply()</code> method to
expect relative <code>XY</code> addresses and add a few more utility methods. Here is the enhanced
<code>View</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>case class View(cells: String) {
    val size = math.sqrt(cells.length).toInt
    val center = XY(size/2, size/2)

    def apply(relPos: XY) = cellAtRelPos(relPos)

    def indexFromAbsPos(absPos: XY) = absPos.x + absPos.y * size
    def absPosFromIndex(index: Int) = XY(index % size, index / size)
    def absPosFromRelPos(relPos: XY) = relPos + center
    def cellAtAbsPos(absPos: XY) = cells.apply(indexFromAbsPos(absPos))

    def indexFromRelPos(relPos: XY) = indexFromAbsPos(absPosFromRelPos(relPos))
    def relPosFromAbsPos(absPos: XY) = absPos - center
    def relPosFromIndex(index: Int) = relPosFromAbsPos(absPosFromIndex(index))
    def cellAtRelPos(relPos: XY) = cells(indexFromRelPos(relPos))
}</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Step__4:_finding_the_nearest_food_item">Step #4: finding the nearest food item</h2>

<p>Let's now add a method that the bot can use to find the nearest food item visible in its
view. In Java style, we might declare such a method with the signature</p>

<pre><code>def offsetToNearest(c: Char) : XY</code></pre>

<p>where we pass the ASCII letter that we're looking for (here, <code>P</code>) as a parameter and expect
the relative <code>XY</code> coordinate as a result.</p>

<p>What if no cell of the desired type is presently visible within the view, however? In Java,
we might return <code>null</code> to indicate this special case, or, somewhat better, we might define
some instance of <code>XY</code> to act as a sentinel value. We might also throw an exception (not that
this would be a good choice here, since it is not really an unexpected occurrence).</p>

<p>But in none of these cases, what the function returns is obvious to a caller without
additional documentation. We might forget to handle a <code>null</code> value and get a
<code>NullPointerException</code>, or we might screw up the comparison to our sentinel value,
which in addition clutters our namespace.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Scala offers a much better approach, which is to return an <code>Option</code> value.
An <code>Option</code> is a generic abstract class whose instances are either <code>None</code> (a singleton)
or a <code>Some</code> value that wraps the actual result value. Using <code>Option</code>, we can change
the signature of our method to:</p>

<pre><code>def offsetToNearest(c: Char) : Option[XY]</code></pre>

<p>All potential users of this method immediately know that the result may be either
<code>None</code> if no such character occurrence is found or <code>Some(xy)</code> if one is found. Using
<code>Option</code> is absolutely the preferred way to handle such cases in Scala and for this
reason most Scala programmers haven't seen a <code>NullPointerException</code> in a long time.</p>

<p>Adopting this signature, we can implement the method in a variety of ways. Here are
three options, just to give you an idea of the options available to you.</p>

<h3 id = "Variant_A:_procedural_style_with__code_for__code_">Variant A: procedural style with <code>for</code></h3>

<p>Here is a version that is closest to the classic procedural style known from Java or C++
(note that this function should reside inside the View class definition):</p>

<pre><code>def offsetToNearest(c: Char) = {
    var nearestPosOpt : Option[XY] = None
    var nearestDistance = Double.MaxValue
    for(i &lt;- 0 until cells.length) {
        if(c == cells(i)) {
            val pos = absPosFromIndex(i)
            val distanceToCenter = pos.distanceTo(center)
            if(distanceToCenter &lt; nearestDistance) {
                nearestDistance = distanceToCenter
                nearestPosOpt = Some(pos - center)
            }
        }
    }
    nearestPosOpt
}</code></pre>

<p>The method uses a <code>for()</code> expression to scans all cell indices in a loop. The <code>for()</code> expression
works by iterating over elements drawn from a <strong>range</strong> (of integers) generated by the expression
<code>0 until cells.length</code>. It uses two mutable values to store the nearest cell found so far and
its distance to the bot.</p>

<p>Using constructs like <code>for()</code>, it is generally straight-forward to translate Java code into
Scala code. In fact, in IntelliJ IDEA, you can copy Java code from a Java source file and
paste it directly as Scala code into a Scala source file, with automatic translation.</p>

<h3 id = "Variant_B:_functional_style">Variant B: functional style</h3>

<p>However, for any such procedural implementation there is generally a more compact and more
elegant purely functional implementation. Having mutable values, doing manual range
comparisons and generally writing code that is longer than necessary introduces opportunities
for errors to sneak in. So here is an example of a functional implementation that gets by
without any mutable state:</p>

<pre><code>def offsetToNearest(c: Char) = {
    val relativePositions =
        cells
        .view
        .zipWithIndex
        .filter(_._1 == c)
        .map(p =&gt; relPosFromIndex(p._2))
    if(relativePositions.isEmpty)
        None
    else
        Some(relativePositions.minBy(_.length))
}</code></pre>

<p>Let's take this apart:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>cells.view</code> indicates that the subsequent call to <code>zipWithIndex</code> should not generate
a new collection instance but rather a transient view onto the existing collection.
This ensures that no new copy of the collection will be made.</li>
<li><code>.zipWithIndex</code> generates a collection of pairs in which each element of the
original collection (the <code>Char</code> elements of our <code>cells</code> <code>String</code>) is paired with its
index in the collection.</li>
<li><code>.filter(_._1 == c)</code> generates a collection that contains only those elements which
match the filter predicate. The predicate we use is <code>_._1 == c</code>, i.e. whether the
first element of the (just-zipped) pair equals the desired character value stored
in <code>c</code>. Note there that the first underscore is an anonymous reference to the parameter
passed to the predicate function. More verbosely, this could be written as
<code>pair =&gt; { pair._1 == c}</code>.</li>
<li><code>.map(p =&gt; relPosFromIndex(p._2))</code> transforms the collection of pairs into a collection
of <code>XY</code> instances representing the relative cell coordinates of the matching cells.
This is achieved by supplying a transform function to match that receives a pair
as its parameter (accessible via the parameter name <code>p</code>) and maps the second element
of the pair (the index) to a relative position via an invocation of <code>relPosFromIndex()</code>.</li>
<li><code>if(relativePositions.isEmpty)</code> then tests whether the resulting collection is empty
(i.e. there were no matches) and if so, returns <code>None</code>. If there were matches,
it uses&hellip;</li>
<li><code>.minBy(_.length)</code> to find the one nearest to the center. This works by supplying a
&ldquo;scoring&rdquo; function to <code>minBy</code> that, for each element in the collection, returns a value
for which an ordering exists (here, an <code>Int</code>). The expression <code>_.length</code> is the usual
short-hand employing an underscore as a reference to the (anonymous) call parameter.
The verbose variant would be <code>relPos =&gt; { relPos.length }</code>.</li>
<li><code>Some(...)</code> finally wraps the result into a <code>Some</code> instance, matching expected the
<code>Option[XY]</code> return type.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id = "Variant_C:_procedural_style_with__code_while__code_">Variant C: procedural style with <code>while</code></h3>

<p>So the functional style is very concise and for many reasons preferable for the vast
majority of code one might write. However, you may have noticed that a lot is going
on here, with several traversals and potential interim copies of the collection being
generated in calls like <code>zipWithIndex</code>. Some of this overhead can be eliminated or
minimized, for example by using <code>view</code> to avoid a copy.</p>

<p>But what about the 1% of your code where you really, absolutely require optimal
efficiency? The answer is that in those rare cases, you may want to write procedural
code with mutable state. And the good news is that you can do that. Here is a more
performance-conscious version of the <code>offsetToNearest</code> method that uses a <code>while</code>
loop to do an efficient traversal:</p>

<pre><code>def offsetToNearest(c: Char) = {
    var nearestPosOpt : Option[XY] = None
    var nearestDistance = Double.MaxValue
    for(i &lt;- 0 until cells.length) {
        if(c == cells(i)) {
            val pos = absPosFromIndex(i)
            val distanceToCenter = pos.distanceTo(center)
            if(distanceToCenter &lt; nearestDistance) {
                nearestDistance = distanceToCenter
                nearestPosOpt = Some(pos - center)
            }
        }
    }
    nearestPosOpt
}</code></pre>

<p>The traversal with <code>while</code> will often be slightly faster than with <code>for</code> because
<code>for</code> will be translated by the compiler into functional code using closures, which
carry a slight overhead.</p>

<p>The takeaway is that initially, Scala allows you to start coding like you would in
Java, using familiar constructs like <code>for</code> loops. As you learn about functional
programming, Scala lets you write concise, error-minimizing functional code for the
99% of your code where productivity trumps performance. In the other 1% of your code
where performance trumps productivity, Scala also lets you write procedural code that
is as fast as anything you might write in Java.</p>

<h3 id = "Variant_D:_but__hellip__there_is_also_parallelism">Variant D: but &hellip; there is also parallelism</h3>

<p>For <em>sequential</em> code, that is. If you expect to be able to exploit multiple CPU
cores, the picture changes again dramatically. Now, purely functional code that embraces
immutability gains an upper hand because it is so much more readily parallelizable.</p>

<p>Let's imagine for a moment that we were not processing a few hundred characters in
a bot view, as we expect to be doing here, but rather millions. What would it take
to parallelize this code to exploit multiple cores? For the procedural code, use
your own experience to judge the amount of work this would take.</p>

<p>For the functional version, here is the only change we'd have to make: we'd replace
the reference to <code>cells</code> at the top with <code>cells.par</code>, turning it into a parallel
collection. That's it.</p>

<p>Here is a real-life example from the Scalatron game server. The primary bottleneck for
the server is the drawing code, which uses unaccelerated Java drawing code. On an 8-core
system, the single-threaded variant of the server generates close to 100% CPU load, i.e.
it loads only a single CPU, as would be expected. After spending an hour or so to add
some hand-crafted threading code to introduce double buffering and parallelize drawing
and state updating, the CPU load rises to 180%. But then, after spending about ten seconds
to add a call to <code>.par</code> in the bot response generation code to parallelize all bot
control function invocations, the load rises to 300%.</p>

<h2 id = "Step__5:_exploiting_the_nearest_food_item">Step #5: exploiting the nearest food item</h2>

<p>Now that we have the <code>offsetToNearest</code> method available, we can use it in our bot's control
function like this:</p>

<pre><code>def respond(input: String): String = {
    val (opcode, paramMap) = CommandParser(input)
    if( opcode == "React" ) {
        val viewString = paramMap("view")
        val view = View(viewString)
        view.offsetToNearest('P') match {
            case Some(offset) =&gt;
                val unitOffset = offset.signum
                "Move(direction=" + unitOffset + ")"
            case None =&gt;
                ""
        }
    } else ""
}</code></pre>

<p>Let's look at what this code does in more detail.</p>

<h3 id = "What_do__code_match__code__and__code_case__code__do_">What do <code>match</code> and <code>case</code> do?</h3>

<p>In Java, we can handle situations in which a value can take on one of several possible
values with a <code>switch</code> statement. Scala provides pattern matching via <code>match</code> and <code>case</code>,
which is more general. To see how this works, let's isolate the associated example code:</p>

<pre><code>view.offsetToNearest('P') match {
    case Some(offset) =&gt; /* handler code */
    case None =&gt; /* handler code */
}</code></pre>

<p>The value to be examined precedes the <code>match</code> keyword. Here, we wish to examine the value
returned by <code>view.offsetToNearest('P')</code>, i.e. an <code>Option</code> value that may or may not contain
an <code>XY</code> instance. Within the curly braces that follow after the <code>match</code> keyword, we define
the cases to be handled. We do this by using the <code>case</code> keyword, followed by the pattern we
want to match against, followed by a <code>=&gt;</code> symbol, followed by the handler code for that case.</p>

<p>So in the code above, since we know the result type of <code>offsetToNearest</code> to be an <code>Option[XY]</code>,
we have two handlers: one for the case where <code>None</code> is returned and one for the case where
<code>Some(offset)</code> is returned.</p>

<p>Like <code>if</code> or <code>try</code>, a <code>match</code> expression yields a value. It is the value associated with
the first matching handler. Here, the handler for <code>None</code> simply yields the empty string; the handler
for <code>Some(offset)</code> assembles a <code>Move</code> command that instructs the bot to move in the direction
of the nearest visible plant.</p>

<p>Some other notes on <code>match</code> and <code>case</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Scala, unlike Java, there is no fall-through from one case to the next.</li>
<li><p>The last pattern can be an underscore ('_'), which matches any pattern:</p>

<p>foo match {
    // handlers for specific cases
    case _ => // handler for everything else
}</p></li>
<li><p>Patterns can be constants, like so:</p>

<p>foo match {
    case &ldquo;Frank&rdquo; => // handler for &ldquo;Frank&rdquo;
    case &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; =>   // handler for &ldquo;Joe&rdquo;
    case &ldquo;Tina&rdquo; =>  // handler for &ldquo;Tina&rdquo;
}</p></li>
<li><p>Patterns can be types, with a symbol name to bind the value to if the type
matches, like so:</p>

<p>foo match {
    case n: Int => println("an Int: " + b)
    case s: String => println("a String: " + s)
    case c: Char => println("a Char: " + c)
}</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Caveat: in Scala, since it is based on and constrained by the Java Virtual Machine and its
generic type system, generic types are subject to type erasure just like they are in Java.
Due to this limitation, <code>case</code> patterns cannot distinguish between variants of a generic
type by subtype. Code like the following will therefore not work:</p>

<pre><code>anOption match {
    case a: Some[A] =&gt; // ...
    case b: Some[B] =&gt; // ...
}</code></pre>

<p>The only exception to this rule is <code>Array</code>, which is not subject to type erasure.</p>

<h3 id = "What_does__code_case_Some_offset___code__do_">What does <code>case Some(offset)</code> do?</h3>

<p>The <code>match</code> expression we just examined contains one <code>case</code> handler that is neither
a constant nor (just) a type:</p>

<pre><code>... match {
    case Some(offset) =&gt; // handler code
}</code></pre>

<p>Here, Scala <em>extracts</em> the value contained in the <code>Some</code> instance for us and binds it
to a symbol <code>offset</code>, which is of type <code>XY</code> (since the matched value was an <code>Option[XY]</code>).</p>

<p>This parameter extraction is available for classes whose companion object implements a
(static) method <code>unapply()</code>, which the compiler uses to extract the class parameters.</p>

<h1 id = "Debugging_Your_Bot">Debugging Your Bot</h1>

<h2 id = "Approaches">Approaches</h2>

<p>One important area was omitted from the tutorial so far: how do you debug your bot code?
There are multiple options. Which one is best depends on your goals and your development
environment. Here are the three main approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Using the Scalatron IDE for browser-based development</strong>: since compilation and execution
occur on the server computer (to which you may not have any other access) and the IDE is
fairly basic, there is no way to debug the code by setting break-points ot single-stepping
through it. You can, however, single-step through the simulation and inspect the input and
state of your entities (bots and mini-bots), as well as have your bot output debug
information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using IntelliJ IDEA with a local test server</strong>: if you are using IDEA to build your
bots (the same may also be true for the Scala IDE), you can install and run a local test
server, have it load your plug-in and then debug with breakpoints and single-stepping
within the IDE. This approach is probably the most powerful. It is recommended for
serious enthusiasts that want to build really clever and complex bots. For more information,
see the chapter on debugging with IDEA in the <em>Player Setup</em> guide.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using local builds with a central tournament server</strong>: the only option for debugging
in this scenario is to use server-side logging into a user-specific directory.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these options will be elaborated on in the next few bot examples of the tutorial.</p>

<h2 id = "Making_State_Visible">Making State Visible</h2>

<p>The debugging approach with longest history is also the simplest: use outputs generated by
your program to trace its behavior at points of interest and to narrow the location of
aberrations. The Scalatron protocol provides several mechanisms for doing this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Status()</strong> &mdash; using the <code>Status</code> opcode, a bot or mini-bot can display a short message
above its location on the tournament screen. This can be used to indicate some aspects of
the state of the bot in a way that is visible while it is running in a multi-player
tournament round. You can, for example, display messages like &ldquo;Searching&hellip;&rdquo; while the bot
is scouting for food, &ldquo;Approaching&hellip;&rdquo; while it is closing in on a food item, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Say()</strong> &mdash; using the <code>Say</code> opcode, a bot or mini-bot can leave a textual &ldquo;bread-crumb&rdquo; at
its current location on the screen. The bread-crumb will stay in its initial location even
when the bot moves away and will gradually fade away over the course of a few seconds.
<code>Say</code> is thus a good way to generate records of events or state changes (as opposed to states
themselves). They remain visible even as the simulation moves on. Examples include messages
like &ldquo;Spotted Food&rdquo;, &ldquo;Proximity Fuse&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fighting&rarr;Harvesting&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Log()</strong> &mdash; using the <code>Log</code> opcode, a bot or mini-bot can record a multi-line debug message
in its entity state. This debug message can be inspected in the browser-based Scalatron IDE
while running in a sandbox. You can essentially record whatever you want, with the unfortunate
limitation that the server's relatively dumb parser must not be confused by it. So certain
characters are not permitted: comma (<code>,</code>), equals sign (<code>=</code>), parentheses (<code>(</code>, <code>)</code>),
pipe (<code>|</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Set()</strong> &mdash; using the <code>Set</code> opcode, a bot or mini-bot can record key/value pairs into the
state parameters which the server maintains for it. These state parameters can be inspected
in the browser-based Scalatron IDE while single-stepping through a sandboxed simulation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the bot examples shown so far, we've gradually introduced command parsing and expanded the
functionality of the bots. It is now time to make the bot structure a bit more elegant. We will
do this in several steps, spread out over multiple example bots. The first step will be to break
the control function up into handlers for the various opcodes sent by the server.</p>

        opcode match {
            case "Welcome" =&gt;
                welcome(
                    params("name"),

<h2 id = "What_is_going_on_">What is going on?</h2>

<p>The changes are quite staright-forward and not Scala-specific, which is why we won't spend
a lot of time on them. Instead of handling the invocations from the server inside the
<code>respond()</code> method, we parse the command and feed it through a <code>match</code>/ <code>case</code>
pattern matcher. The pattern matcher contains one handler for each of the opcodes the
server may send (we ignore unknown opcodes).</p>

<p>Each handler extracts frequently-used parameters from the parsed parameter maps and
feeds them as arguments to an opcode-specific handler method:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>welcome()</code> method handles the <code>Welcome</code> opcode</li>
<li>the <code>react()</code> method handles the <code>React</code> opcode</li>
<li>the <code>goodbye()</code> method handles the <code>Goodbye</code> opcode</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the <code>react()</code> handler method we inspect the entity for which a response is
required and then branch into the appropriate entity-specific handler:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>reactAsMaster()</code> method handles <code>React</code> invocations for the (master) bot</li>
<li>the <code>reactAsSlave()</code> method handles <code>React</code> invocations for mini-bots</li>
</ul>

<p>When you build and publish this bot, you will see that the master bot displays a little
status text bubble saying &ldquo;Master&rdquo; next to it.</p>
