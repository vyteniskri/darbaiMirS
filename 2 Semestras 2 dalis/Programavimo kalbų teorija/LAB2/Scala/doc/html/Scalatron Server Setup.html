<p>Scalatron is an educational resource for groups of programmers that want to learn more about
the Scala programming language or want to hone their Scala programming skills. It is based on
Scalatron BotWar, a competitive multi-player programming game in which coders pit bot programs
(written in Scala) against each other.</p>

<p>The documentation, tutorial and source code are intended as a community resource and are
in the public domain. Feel free to use, copy, and improve them!</p>

<h1 id = "Summary">Summary</h1>

<p>Scalatron is a game server application running on a central computer. This server hosts
the bot tournament by continuously simulating short rounds of the Scalatron BotWar game. Players
participate in the tournament by publishing their bots into the server.</p>

<p>To publish a bot, a player has to provide the server with a <code>.jar</code> archive file that contains the
bot's control function, which was implemented in Scala and then compiled. There are two approaches
to doing this, which in the Scalatron documentation are referred to as the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; and &ldquo;casual&rdquo;
paths, respectively.</p>

<h2 id = "The__ldquo_Serious_rdquo__Path">The &ldquo;Serious&rdquo; Path</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;serious&rdquo; path is intended for experienced programmers planning for a longer bot coding
session (5-7 hours).</p>

<p>On this path, bots are built locally by each player, using an IDE or command
line tools. The bots are then published into the tournament by copying them into the plug-in
directory on the central computer from which the game server loads them at the start of each
round.</p>

<h3 id = "Pros:">Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Players can work with the editor of their choice and can use the build tools they are already
accustomed to.</li>
<li>Working with an IDE allows for very comfortable debugging with breakpoints and
single-stepping.</li>
<li>Each player ends up with a fully configured Scala build environment and is able to keep
coding in Scala beyond the bot coding session.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id = "Cons:">Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The server administrator has to set up network sharing for the plug-in directory.</li>
<li>Each player has to set up a local working environment (IDE, SBT or command line).</li>
<li>Based on experience, setting this up can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "The__ldquo_Casual_rdquo__Path">The &ldquo;Casual&rdquo; Path</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;casual&rdquo; path is intended for less experienced programmers or for shorter bot coding sessions
(2-3 hours).</p>

<p>On this path, players write, build, debug and publish their bots in a web browser. The
browser-based development environment is provided by an embedded web server which is hosted
inside the game server and requires no setup by the user.</p>

<h3 id = "Pros:">Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Players do not have to install or configure anything.</li>
<li>The server administrator does not have to configure a network-shared directory; just unzip
the distribution and double-click the application.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id = "Cons:">Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Debugging is only possible via state watches and debug output in the browser; no breakpoints
can be set in the code and no variables can be inspected at run time.</li>
<li>After the tournament, players leave without a working local development environment.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id = "Setup_Steps">Setup Steps</h1>

<h2 id = "The__ldquo_Serious_rdquo__Path">The &ldquo;Serious&rdquo; Path</h2>

<ol>
<li>Select a computer to be the central server</li>
<li>Unzip the Scalatron distribution on that server</li>
<li>Configure a directory for sharing over the network with read/write access for all players</li>
<li>Make sure that a Java Runtime Environment is available on the server computer</li>
<li>Launch the game application</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id = "The__ldquo_Casual_rdquo__Path">The &ldquo;Casual&rdquo; Path</h2>

<ol>
<li>Select a computer to be the central server</li>
<li>Unzip the Scalatron distribution on that server</li>
<li>Make sure that a Java Runtime Environment is available on the server computer</li>
<li>Launch the game application</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ol>

<h1 id = "Installing_the_Scalatron_Server">Installing the Scalatron Server</h1>

<p><strong>Installation is required for both the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; and &ldquo;casual&rdquo; paths.</strong></p>

<p>The following setup steps were tested on MacOS X 10.6.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Optional: provide a dedicated computer for the Scalatron game server which you will use during
the live coding workshop. Change the name of that computer to something users will easily
recognize on the network, such as <code>Scalatron</code>. On MacOS X, you can do this in the
<strong>System Preferences</strong> app via the icon <strong>Sharing</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Optional: create an account that you will use to run the Scalatron game server during the
live coding workshop, for example for a user <code>Scalatron</code> with standard user rights.
On MacOS X, you can do this in the <strong>System Preferences</strong> app via the icon <strong>Accounts</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Log in as the user account that you will use for running the game server. In this example setup,
that account would be <code>Scalatron</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now copy the compressed Scalatron distribution archive of the version you want to use
(e.g. <code>scalatron-0.9.7.zip</code>) into the parent directory (e.g. <code>/Users/Scalatron</code>) and
decompress it there. This will create a sub-directory called <code>scalatron-0.9.7</code> containing
a directory <code>Scalatron</code>. Move that <code>Scalatron</code> directory below your user directory.
On MacOS X, the path to this directory would then be <code>/Users/Scalatron/Scalatron</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The structure you want to end up with is roughly the following:</p>

<p>/Users
    /Scalatron
        /Scalatron
            /bin
                Scalatron.jar
            /bots
                /BrownianMotion
                    ScalatronBot.jar
            /doc
            /src</p></li>
<li><p>Now either open a console, navigate to the <code>bin</code> directory and launch the app, using e.g.</p>

<pre><code>cd /Users/Scalatron/Scalatron/bin
java -jar Scalatron.jar</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Or just double-click on the <code>Scalatron.jar</code> file in the <code>bin</code> directory.</p></li>
<li><p>The game server will then tell you where it is looking for plug-ins (the default location is
a <code>bots</code> directory that resides next to the <code>bin</code> directory from which the app was launched)
and which address players can point their browsers to (the default is the host name of the
server computer with port 8080, e.g. &ldquo;http://scalatron:8080&rdquo;).</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id = "Sharing_the_Plug-in_Directory">Sharing the Plug-in Directory</h1>

<p><strong>This step is not required for the &ldquo;casual&rdquo; path.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once you got the server application to launch, share the bot directory so that the players
can upload their bot files. On a game server running MacOS X, you can do this as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>open the <strong>System Preferences</strong> application</li>
<li>click the icon <strong>Sharing</strong></li>
<li>in the list <strong>Shared Folders</strong> in the middle, click <code>+</code> to add a new shared folder</li>
<li>this may require you to enter an administrator password</li>
<li>then browse to the <code>bots</code> folder (e.g. at <code>/Users/Scalatron/Scalatron/bots</code>) and add
that folder as a network share</li>
<li>set the permissions on the <code>bots</code> folder so that <code>everyone</code> can <code>Read &amp; Write</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Test that it works. On a participant computer running MacOS X, you would do this as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>open a <strong>Finder</strong> window</li>
<li>in the main menu, select <strong>Go > Network</strong></li>
<li>under <strong>Network</strong>, you should now see an entry for the game server computer (e.g. <code>Scalatron</code>)</li>
<li>click on it</li>
<li>you should now briefly see a message <code>connecting...</code></li>
<li>then a folder called <code>bots</code> should appear</li>
<li>click on it</li>
<li>if you created the file structure on the server by unzipping the Scalatron archive (e.g. <code>scalatron-0.9.5.zip</code>)
then the folder should now already show a range of directories: the example bots, e.g.
<code>BrownianMotion</code> and <code>FoodFetcher</code>. Each directory should contain a Scala source file and
a <code>ScalatronBot.jar</code> plug-in.</li>
<li>now try to create a new player directory in the <code>bots</code> folder. If you were doing this
for a player (i.e., programmer) called <strong>Tina</strong>, then the new directory would be called
<code>Tina</code>.</li>
<li>control-click on the new directory and select <strong>Get Info</strong>. This will pop up a window
where you can see the file system path on the local system for the player's remote plug-in
directory. It will be something like <code>/Volumes/bots/Tina</code>.</li>
<li>now copy one of the existing <code>ScalatronBot.jar</code> files into the <code>Tina</code> directory.</li>
<li>if that works, you have the proper file access permissions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Setting the permissions on the <code>bots</code> folder on the game server so that <code>everyone</code> can <code>Read &amp; Write</code>
lets users create new directories for their plug-ins in the bots folder. But it will not allow
the game server to write files into those directories while the game is running. This, however,
is required so that the debug logging explained in the Scalatron Tutorial works. To make this
work, you need to expand the permissions on the shared folder. On MacOS X you can do this
<strong>on the game server</strong> as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>open a <strong>Finder</strong> window</li>
<li>browse to the <code>bots</code> folder, e.g. at <code>/Users/Scalatron/Scalatron/bots</code></li>
<li>control-click to open a context menu, then select <strong>Get Info</strong></li>
<li>in the window that pops up, click the lock at the bottom right to make changes;
this may prompt you to enter an Administrator password</li>
<li>the permissions on the folder should already be set so that <code>everyone</code> can <code>Read &amp; Write</code></li>
<li>now click on the little toothed wheel at the bottom and select <strong>Apply to enclosed items&hellip;</strong></li>
<li>this will propagate the access permissions to all the enclosed plug-in directories</li>
<li>now the bots should be able to create log files in their plug-in directories</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id = "Configuring_the_Scalatron_Server">Configuring the Scalatron Server</h1>

<p><strong>This step is optional for both the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; and &ldquo;casual&rdquo; paths.</strong></p>

<p>The Scalatron game application can be launched either from the command line or by double-clicking it.
This will launch the application in its default configuration, which in most cases will be
sufficient. To launch it with a different configuration, you must use the command line. You can
display a list of command line options by using the single option <code>-help</code>:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar Scalatron.jar -help</code></pre>

<p>The parameters available on the command line fall into three groups, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>java java-options -jar Scalatron.jar scalatron-options botwar-options</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Java_VM_Options">Java VM Options</h2>

<p>The options for configuring the Java Virtual Machine apply where the command line option
example above contains the string <code>java-options</code>. Here you can provide the usual JVM launch
options, including:</p>

<pre><code>-server
-Xmx512M</code></pre>

<p>Recommended options:</p>

<pre><code>-server -Xmx512M</code></pre>

<h2 id = "Scalatron_Server_Options">Scalatron Server Options</h2>

<p>The options for configuring the Scalatron server framework apply where the command line option
example above contains the string <code>scalatron-options</code>. These include:</p>

<pre><code>-verbose yes|no         print verbose output (default: no)

-headless yes|no        run without visual output (default: no)
-rounds int             run this many tournament rounds, then exit (default: unlimited)
-plugins directory      Scalatron plugin base directory (default: ../bots)
-browser yes|no         open a web browser showing browser UI (default: yes)

-port int               port to serve browser UI &amp; REST API at (default: 8080)
-webui directory        directory containing browser UI (default: ../webui)
-users directory        directory containing browser UI workspaces (default: ../users)
-samples directory      directory containing example bots (default: ../samples)</code></pre>

<p>Recommended options:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will generally not need to modify any of these settings if you have installed the server
by unzipping the Scalatron distribution, since all directories will be in the places where
the server expects them.</li>
<li>If for some reason you would like the server to load its bot plug-ins from a different
directory (for example because you have an existing network share), you can point the server
to that directory using <code>-plugins</code> option.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "BotWar_Game_Options">BotWar Game Options</h2>

<p>The options for configuring the BotWar game run by the Scalatron server apply where the command line option example above contains the string <code>botwar-options</code>. These include:</p>

<pre><code>-frameX int|max        window width (pixels; `max` = full screen; default: 640)
-frameY int|max        window height (pixels; `max` = full screen; default: 500)

-steps int             steps per game cycle (default: 5000)
-maxfps int            maximum steps/second (to reduce CPU load; default: 50)

-x int                 game arena width (cells; default: depends on plugin count)
-y int                 game arena height (cells; default: depends on plugin count)
-perimeter option      arena perimeter: none, open, or closed (default: open)

-walls int             count of wall elements in arena (default: x*y/300)
-zugars int            count of good plants in arena (default: x*y/250)
-toxifera int          count of bad plants in arena (default: x*y/350)
-fluppets int          count of good beasts in arena (default: x*y/350)
-snorgs int            count of bad beasts in arena (default: x*y/500)</code></pre>

<p>Recommended options:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will generally not need to modify any of these settings.</li>
<li>The server determines the <code>-frameX</code> and <code>-frameY</code> parameters using the size of the screen
on which the window will appear. Adjust only if that does not give adequate results.</li>
<li>The server determines the <code>-x</code> and <code>-y</code> parameters based on the number of plug-ins
loaded each round. The default will be a square arena whose cell count increases with the
player count. Adjust only if that does not give adequate results.</li>
<li>For the initial experimental phase (focus on quick turn-around) use arund 1000 steps per
game round: <code>-steps 1000</code></li>
<li>For the later refinement/competition phase, use up to 10000 steps per game
round: <code>-steps 10000</code></li>
<li>You can significantly change the nature of the game by reducing or increasing the number
of entities of various kinds that the simulator sprinkles into the arena. Try <code>-snorgs 300</code>
or <code>-walls 0</code>.</li>
<li>If your server CPU load is too high and the browser-based Scalatron IDE is sluggish to
respond to user requests (e.g. builds take a long time), try throttling the CPU load of the
simulation loop by specifying a maximum frame rate with the <code>-maxfps</code> option, for example
using <code>-maxfps 20</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "Examples">Examples</h2>

<pre><code>java -server -jar Scalatron.jar -plugins /Users/Scalatron/Scalatron/bots
java -server -jar Scalatron.jar -x 200 -y 150 -frameX 640 -frameY 500</code></pre>

<h1 id = "Keyboard_Commands">Keyboard Commands</h1>

<p>The following keyboard commands are available by typing into the game server's display
window while games are in progress:</p>

<ul>
<li>space &mdash; freeze/unfreeze the action</li>
<li>'1'   &mdash; no delay between simulation steps</li>
<li>'2'   &mdash; delay = 50ms</li>
<li>'3'   &mdash; delay = 100ms</li>
<li>'4'   &mdash; delay = 250ms</li>
<li>'5'   &mdash; delay = 500ms</li>
<li>'6'   &mdash; delay = 1000ms</li>
<li>'7'   &mdash; delay = 2000ms</li>
<li>'h'   &mdash; show/hide bot horizons</li>
<li>'r'   &mdash; abort current round, reload all plug-ins and start next round;
       round counter and leaderboard are unaffected;
       useful while developing bots to prompt immediate re-scan for updated plug-ins</li>
<li>'+/-' &mdash; step focus through players</li>
</ul>

<h1 id = "The_Screen_Layout">The Screen Layout</h1>

<p>When launched, the Scalatron server application displays a window that consists of the
following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>top left / main area: the game arena. This is the playing field in which bots compete.</li>
<li>bottom left area: the statistics panel. Shows operational data for the game server:
<ul>
<li>the index of the game round currently in progress</li>
<li>the number of steps computed so far and the total number to compute</li>
<li>the real-time duration of the game round so far, in seconds</li>
<li>the average per-frame time during the current game round, in milliseconds</li>
<li>the number of bots (players, beasts, plants and walls) in the game</li>
<li>the number of decorations (explosions, bonks, bonus breadcrumbs etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>top right area: the score board. Displays, for each player and sorted by score, the following information:
<ul>
<li>at left, from the top:
<ul>
<li>the player�s bot icon</li>
<li>the player�s name (the name of the plug-in directory)</li>
<li>the player�s score</li>
</ul></li>
<li>at right, from the top:
<ul>
<li>the time spent in the plug-in�s control function, in milliseconds. If the game slows down because some player is hogging CPU resources, you�ll be able to see it here.</li>
<li>the rank of the player (e.g. �#1�)</li>
<li>the quartile of the player (e.g. �1st Q�). The quartile is based on the player�s relative rank. It affects the distance from which beasts in the game can sense the player�s master bot.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>bottom right area: the leader board. Displays the player(s) that had&hellip;
<ul>
<li>the highest score(s) in the most recent round</li>
<li>the highest average score(s) across the most recent 5 rounds</li>
<li>the highest average score(s) across the most recent 20 rounds</li>
<li>the highest average score(s) across all rounds</li>
</ul></li>
