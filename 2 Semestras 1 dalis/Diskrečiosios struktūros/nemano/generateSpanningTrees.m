%GENERATESPANNINGTREES Generate all spanning trees for an undirected graph
%   This function generates all spanning trees for the undirected simple
%   graph that is described by the adjacency matrix A. It is an
%   implementation of 'Algorithm S' on p. 464 in The Art of Computer
%   Programming, Volume 4A (Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1), by Donald E.
%   Knuth.
%
%   The output comprises an index matrix idx, which, for every spanning
%   tree, comprises the indices of the source and destination vertices. For
%   example, the following code outputs, for every spanning tree, a matrix
%   with the vertices of all its edges:
%
%    [idx, src, dst] = lib.generateSpanningTrees(A);
%    for n = 1:size(idx, 2)      % Iterate through all spanning trees
%        % Output source and destination vertex of all edges of spanning tree n:
%        [src(idx(:, n)), dst(idx(:, n))]
%    end

% NOTE 1: Beforehand, I apologize for the rather tightly bounded beauty of
% the code below. I hope the tight bound gave rise to more efficiency.
% NOTE 2: This code does not include the improvements of 'Algorithm S' as
% described on p. 467 in TAOCP, vol. 4A, and the heurists for the bridge
% test, cf. p. 803 in TAOCP, vol. 4A, are omitted as well. For my purposes,
% they were not necessary, so I preferred to keep the code as slim as
% possible. However, you are welcome to add them ;)
% NOTE 3: When the number of spanning trees is large, returning the result
% as done here is very memory demanding. In this case you may, e.g., modify
% the code to use a callback function to process a newly found spanning
% tree in order to avoid storing them all. The section of the code, where
% the result is stored, is highlighted.
