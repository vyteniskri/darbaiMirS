%GETNUMBERSPANNINGTREES Get the number of spanning trees for adjacency matrix A
%   Returns the number of spanning trees for the connected undirected simple
%   graph described by the adjacency matrix A. The number of spanning trees
%   is determined using Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem (cf., e.g., Russell
%   Merris, 'Laplacian Matrices of Graphs: A Survey', Linear Algebra and
%   its Applications, vol. 197-198, p. 143-176, 1994).
